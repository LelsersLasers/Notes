# Viruses, Viroids, and Prions

## Viruses

- Viruses are not alive
- 3 parts:
	- Protein
		- Capsid
			- A shell, made up of capsomeres
				- Capsomeres fit like legos to form a shell
	- Nucleic acid
		- DNA or RNA
		- Single stranded or double stranded
	- ? Lipid
		- Most don't have a lipid part
		- Some have a lipid envelope
		- Ex that have: Influenza, Retrouviruses (HIV)
1. Viruses bind to a cell receptor
	- A bit like lock and key
2. Ways to get inside the cell:
	- Endocytosis
		- Virus binds to receptor, then the cell engulfs it
		- Usually the non lipid way
	- Fusion
		- Virus binds to receptor, then fuses with the cell membrane
		- Usually the lipid way
	- Phage
		- Bateria viruses = bateria phages
		- Lands on the bateria and injects the geneome through the cell wall
			- No receptor needed
3. Genome gets out of capsid (into host cell)
	- Capsid breaks down in various ways
		- Does not need to for Phage

### Once inside the cell

- Once inside the cell, the virus wants spread
	- Uses the host's machinery to make more copies of itself
		- If RNA, translation to DNA using the host's RNA polymerase
			- Some viruses have their own RNA &rarr; RNA copier (because it is not present in the host)
				- RNA dependent RNA polymerase
		- If DNA, transcription to RNA then translation to protein
			- Don't need to bring DNA &rarr; RNA or RNA &rarr; protein (present is host)
			- Add the virus's DNA to the host's DNA
				- So when host divides, the virus's DNA is copied
- "+ strand RNA virus": the host can translate the RNA directly using the host's ribosomes
- "- strand RNA virus": the host can't translate the RNA directly, so it needs to make a copy of the RNA
	- "- strand" is the complementary strand
- RNA viruses need to do RNA &rarr; DNA to get into the host's DNA
	- Reverse transcription
	- Not something the host can do
		- Virus must bring its own reverse transcript*ase*
	- Integrase: moves virus's DNA into the host's DNA
		- Virus must bring this
- Once the virus affects the host's DNA, the virus needs a way to pop it out
	- Otherwise, just sitting on the host's chromosomes
	- When the modifed DNA is transcribed, it makes new packaged viruses
		- Turns a 1 copy of virus on the DNA into many copies
- Retrovirus: 
	- any of a family of RNA viruses that have an enzyme (reverse transcriptase) capable of making a complementary DNA copy of the viral RNA, which then is integrated into a host cellâ€™s DNA. The family includes a number of significant pathogens, typically causing tumors or affecting the function of the immune system, e.g. HIV.
- Licogenetic
	- Virus sneaks into the genome
	- Ex: retrovirus
- Litic phase
	- When the virus pops out

### RNA mutates

- RNA does not have a proofreading mechanism
	- So it is more prone to mutation
	- RNA viruses mutate more than DNA viruses
		- Harder to devolpement counters to it (changes too much/fast)

## Viroids

- Just 1 loop of single stranded RNA
	- No lipid or protein parts
- Can copy itself
	- As it builds, the RNA folds into a enzyme that cuts the the strand into new loops
- Ribozymes
	- RNA that acts like an enzyme

## Prions

- Only protein
	- No nucleic acid or lipid
	- Works by converting other proteins to itself
- Ex: Mad Cow Disease
	- Scrapie: sheep
	- Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease: cross species (ex: humans get it from cows)
- All mammals have a protein called PrP (c)
	- Structure: a couple of alpha helices
- PrP (sc)
	- Structure: a couple of beta sheets
		- Very stable, doesn't really denature at all
	- Same primary sequence as PrP (c) but folded differently
- If PrP (sc) touches PrP (c), it will change the structure of PrP (c) to PrP (sc)
	- PrP (sc) is infectious
		- If you eat 1 PrP (sc), it starts a chain reaction that eventually turns all of your PrP (c) into PrP (sc)
		- If 1 cow gets it, all the cows get it
	- PrP (c) is not infectious (in all mammals)

# Cell communication

- Endocrin
	- Circulates looking for matching receptors
- Paracrine
	- Releases a short distance messenger that targets specific cells
- 3 steps:
	1. Recption: binding of ligand to receptor
	2. Transduction: passing the signal from the receptor to the cell
	3. Response: what cAMP does


## Paracrine

- Example:
	- Bateria exposed on skin
	- Skin sends cytokines singaling to blood to release macrophages to kill bateria
- Development
	- Cells divide and need to tell other cells what they are doing
		- (ex: "I am going to be the left side, so you go to the right)

## Endocrine

### Adrenaline (epinephrine)

- A hormone
- Adrenaline is small polar
	- Can not get across the cell membrane
	- Needs a extra-cellular receptor
- Adrenaline receptor: g-protien coupled receptor (GPCR)
	- Crosses the membrane 7 times
	- Ends with 3 subunits
		- Alpha, beta, gamma
		- The alpha is bound to GDP
	- Lock and key match
	- The same 1 adrenaline molecule can bind to 1000 receptors (not at the same time though)
- Adrenaline binds to the receptor
	- The charge from the Adrenaline changes the shape of the receptor (which is given shape by its charges)
	- Kicks the GDP off the alpha subunit
		- Alpha subunit now binds to GTP
		- Causes the alpha subunit to dissociate from the receptor
- Alpha subunit binds to Adenylate cyclase (AC)
	- AC converts ATP to cAMP
		- cAMP diffuses throught the cell
		- Second messenger

### Testosterone (androgen)

- Hormone
- Built from cholesterol
	- Non polar
- Androgen receptor
	- Within the cell's cytoplasm
		- Testrosterone can cross the cell membrane
	- Lock and key match
- When testosterone and androgen receptor bind, the receptor changes shape
	- The receptor kicks off protiens keeping it in the cytoplasm
		- The receptor is now free to move into the nucleus
		- Becomes a transcription factor

## Neurons

- Axon: sends signal
	- Synaptic terminal: end of the axon
	- Synapse/synaptic cleft: space between axon and dendrite
- Glutamate: amino acid - polar
	- Needs a receptor to cross the cell membrane
- To signal: dumps glut into synaptic cleft
	- Picked up by a receptor and does g-protein coupled receptor stuff
	- If the receptor is bound, it also opens an ion channel to allow sodium (positive) to flow into the cell
		- This causes the cell to fire an action potential, passing the signal along the axon to the next neuron

## Kinase

- Substrate &rarr; substrate + phosphate

### Phosphorylation cascade

- Kinase uses a different kinase as a substrate
	- Amplifies in a downward cone

### Cancer

- A lot of kinases are important for cell disecions
	- Ex: Ras, Src
- If it mutates to give the impression that Ras is always active, it will always trigger other kinases

# Gene regulation

- Polycistronic gene regulation in bacteria
	- Monocistronic in humans
- Operator
	- DNA sequence that a repressor binds to
- Operon: a group of genes that are transcribed together (and regulated together)
	- Ex: lac, trp operon

## Eukaryotic gene regulation

- Monocistronic: 1 mRNA = 1 protein
	- 1 promoter = 1 gene
- Gene: enhancer-promoter:exon/introns:terminator
- Enhancer: upstream of the promoter
	- Binds to a transcription factor
	- Loosens the chromatin so RNA polymerase can bind
		- Lower methylation (tightness of coils of DNA)
		- Increase histone acetylation
			- Histones then let go of DNA
		- Effectivly chooses which parts of the DNA are read by RNA polymerase
	- Enhancer is not part of the gene
- Promoter: where RNA polymerase binds
- Terminator signals to create PolyA tail
- Exons: expressed - kept
- Introns: not expressed - cut out
- Alternative splicing: different combinations of exons
	- Ex: different proteins from the same gene
	- Can not change the order of the exons, but choose which ones to keep

### MicroRNA

- UTR: untranslated region
	- 3' UTR
		- 3' end of the mRNA
	- 5' UTR
		- 5' end of the mRNA
- Ago (protein) binds to a small bit of RNA (microRNA) = RISC (RNA induced silencing complex)
	- MicroRNA is 21 nucleotides long
	- Complementary to a sequence in the 3' UTR
		- Binds to mRNA
		- Blocks it from being translated (or just degrades it)
- A seperate gene codes for the microRNA (miRNA)
	- Primary-microRNA
	- Drosha (protein) cuts the primary-microRNA
		- pri-miRNA &rarr; pre-miRNA
	- Dicer (protein) cuts the pre-miRNA
		- 2 microRNA molecules
- Adds another layer of gene regulation
	- 1 microRNA can target many genes

## Prokaryotic gene regulation

- Polycistronic: 1 mRNA = multiple proteins
	- 1 promoter = multiple genes
		- 1 long thing
		- Makes sense, if you only want B if you have A, you can just put them together

### Trp operon

- Gene: trpR-promoter-operator-trpE-trpD-trpC-trpB-trpA-terminator
- Trypophan binds to a repressor protein that binds to the operator which blocks RNA polymerase from binding and building
	- Similar to feedback inhibition
- Precursor (DNA) &rarr; a lot of enzymes &rarr; Tryptophan (amino acid)

### Lac operon

- Gene: lacI-promoter-operator-lacZ-lacY-lacA-terminator
- Lactose binds to the lac repressor which stop the repressor from binding to the operator
	- Opposite of trp operon
	- Lactose present: repressor off - operon on
		- Lactose = inducer
