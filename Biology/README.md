## The chemistry of life

### The process of science

- Inductive reasoning:
    - Particular results to produce general scientific principles
    - "Descriptive/discovery" science
- Deductive reasoning:
    - Logical thinking to predict results by applying scientific principles or practices
    - Hypothesis-based science
- Science:
    - Knowledge that covers general truths or the operation of general laws, especially when acquired and tested by the scientific method
    - Fields of study that attempt to comprehend the nature of the universe
- Scientific method:
    - A method of research with defined steps that include experiments and careful observation
    - Observation -> question (-> hypothesis -> if..then.. prediction)
- Hypothesis:
    - A suggested explanation for an event, which can be tested
    - Falsifiable: able to be disproven by experimental results
- Variable: can change or vary during an experiment
- Control group: every feature that is not manipulated (held constant)
- Theory: a tested and confirmed explanation for observations or phenomena
- Natural Sciences:
    - Fields of science related to the physical world and its phenomena and processes
    - "Hard science" (use quantitative data)
    - Life sciences:
        - Study living things (biology)
    - Physical sciences
        - Study nonliving matter (astronomy, geology, physics, chemistry)
- Basic ("pure") science: knowledge for knowledge's sake
- Applied science: solve real world problems
- Peer-reviewed manuscripts:
    - Scientific papers reviewed by other scientists
    - System of quality control, sharing, and improving/expanding
    - Abstract: concise summary
    - Results section does not contain any interpertion

### Properties of life

#### Order
- Organized and structured
#### Response to Stimuli
#### Reproduction
    - Pass DNA/genes
#### Adaptation
    - Consquence of natural selection
#### Growth and development
#### Regulation/Homeostasis
    - Retain a "steady state"
#### Energy Processing
#### Evolution
    - Diversity from mutations (random changes over time)

### Levels of order

- Atom:
    - Smallest unit that is an element
    - Nucleus surrounded by electrons
- Molecule: 2 or more atoms held together by chemical bonds
- Macromolecules:
    - Large molecules formed by polymerization
        - Polymer: a large molecule that is made by combining smaller units called monomers, which are simpler than macromolecules
- Organelles:
    - Cells contain combinations of macromolecules surrounded by membranes (???)
    - Small structures within cells
- Cell:
    - Smallest unit of structure and function in living organisms
    - Note: viruses are not alive becaue they are not made of cells
    - Prokaryotes: single-cell or colonial organisms without a membrance-bond neclei
    - Eukaryotes: have membrance-bound organelles and nucleus
- Tissues:
    - groups of similar cells doing similar things
- Organs: collection of tissues
- Organ system: collection of functionally related organs
- Organisms: individual living entities
- Population: all the individuals of a species in an area
- Community: sum of populations in an area
- Ecosystem: all the living things in an area with the abiotic, non-living parts of that environment (ex: nitrogen in the soil or rain water)
- Biosphere: collection of all ecosystems (and represents the zones of life on Earth including land, water, and atmosphere)

### The diversity of life

- Evolution:
    - The source of diversity
    - The process of change from which a new species arises from the older species
- Phylogenetic tree:
    - A diagram showing the evolutionary relationships among biological species
    - Based on similarities and differences in genetic or physical traits or both
    - Nodes and branches

## Big Ideas

### Evolution

- The process of evolution drives the diversity and unity of life
- Organisms are linked by lines of descent from common ancestry
- Organisms share many conserved core processes and features that evolved and are widely distributed among organisms today
- Organisms share many conserved core processes and features that evolved and are widely distributed among organisms today



### Energy and Homeostasis
### Information and Communication
### Systems and Interactions
