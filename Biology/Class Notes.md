## 9/21

Membrane transport

### Diffusion

- Passive transport: no energy required
- Movement of molecules from high to low concentration
    - End up fairly equally spread out
- Simple diffusion
    - If a molecule is small and nonpolar, it can diffuse through the membrane
    - If the molecule is big, it can't fit slip through the membrane, but can go through a channel

        - Held in shape by hydrogen bonds
    - Substrate is now bound to the enzyme

# 10/7

## Enzyme regulation

- Allosteric site
    - Not the active site
    - But if something (allosteric effecteur) goes into a allosteric site, the shape of the active site changes
        - Can "shut off"/inhibite the active site and thus the enzyme
- Non-competitive (allosteric) inhibition
    - The inhibitor binds to the allosteric site
        - Changes the shape of the active site
        - Prevents the substrate from binding
    - Also part of the inhibitor could litterally block the active site
        - (But the inhibitor is binded on the allosteric site, not the active site)
- Competitive inhibition
    - The substrate competes with the inhibitor for the same active site
    - Litterally blocks the substrate from attaching to active site
- ![Enzyme Inhibitation](./Photos/EnzymeInhibition.png)
- Enzymes like optimal conditions
    - Usually don't like: high temperature, low pH
    - Salt concentration, and other environmental variables can also effect it
- Some enzymes are built, but require cofactors/coenzymes to turn on/activate/function
    - Cofactor
        - Inorganic (not carbon based)
    - Coenzyme
        - Organic
- Gene regulation
    - Don't build enzymes until they are needed
- Feedback inhibition
    - The product of a pathway inhibits an earlier enzyme in the pathway
    - Prevents the pathway from continuing
        - Prevents the cell from wasting energy/resources/space
    - ![Enzyme Feedback inhibition](./Photos/EnzymeFeedbackInhibition.jpg)

        - Hungry for electrons
            - NADP+ + 2e- + 2H &rarr; NADPH
- If the cell runs out of ATP or NADPH, it will stop the calvin cycle
    - The cell will store up ATP/NADPH from the sun and but the calvin cycle will run as long as there is ATP/NADPH

## Light dependant reactions

### Bridge reaction

- Pyruvate into the mitochondria matrix
    - Requires sufficient oxygen
- Pyruvate &rarr; acetyl CoA
    1. 1 CO2 out
    2. 1 NADH out
    3. Uses Coenzyme A ("CoA")

### Krebs cycle

- Mitochondria
    - Matrix
- Completes oxidation of organic fuel into CO2
    - Acetate from acetyl CoA + oxaloacetate &rarr; citrate
    - Oxaloacetate is recycled and acetate is broken down to CO2
- In:
    - Pyruvate from glucose
        - 2 per glucose
    - (CoA)
    - NAD+
    - FAD
    - ADP + Pi 
- Turns carbon bonds into energy and CO2
- Hyopxia = low oxygen
- Per pyruvate (2x for each glucose):
    - Bridge:
        - 1 CO2 out
        - 1 NADH out
    - Krebs:
        - 2 CO2 out
        - 3 NADH out
        - 1 FADH2 out
        - 1 ATP out
    - Result:
        - NADH and FADH2 &rarr; oxidative phosphorylation
        - CO2 follows gradient to go away
        - ATP (already used)

### Electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation

- ![Electron transport chain](https://cdn.kastatic.org/ka-perseus-images/0ff21c52cd544c8a51014fcbbc2ec144f32cd698.png)
- Mitochondria
    - The folds
    - Cristae
- ATP
    - Chemiosmosis (oxidative phosphorylation)
    - Only 4 without this
        - 2 from glycolysis and 2 from krebs
    - Most comes from energy in the electrons of NADH and FADH2
        - Powers moves H+ to power ATP synthase
- ATP synthase
    - Powered by H+ moving with the gradient
        - Works by spinning to turn ADP + Pi into ATP
    - "Oxidative phosphorylation"
    - NADH &rarr; 3ish ATP
        - 10 NADH &rarr; 30ish ATP
    - FADH2 &rarr; 2ish ATP
        - 2 FADH2 &rarr; 4ish ATP
- Oxygen = final electron acceptor
    - Oxygen will take electrons in any "form"
    - Electrons lose a bit of energy when they are passed down the chain to move H+

### Overall

- C6H12O6 + 6O2 + 6H2O &rarr; 6CO2 + 12H2O + energy
    - 60% of energy is released as heat
    - 34-36x (ADP + P &rarr; ATP)
- ![Cellular Respiration ATP](./Photos/CellularRespirationATP.png)

### Anaerobic respiration

- Glycolysis makes 2 ATP with (`aerobic`) or without (`anaerobic`) oxygen
- Without oxygen, various fermentation pathways generate ATP and recycle NAD+
    - Needs NAD+ to continue glycolysis
- Alcohol fermentation
    - Pyruvate into ethanol
    - 2x pyruvate &rarr; 2x acetaldehyde + 2x CO2 &rarr; 2x ethanol
- Lactic acid fermentation
    - Pyruvate is reduced directly by NADH into lactate
    - Muscle cells switch from aerobic to anaerobic respiration when oxygen is low
        - Creating "burning" sensation
        - Allows for a little more energy to be made
        - Latic acid eventually goes to liver
- Makes 2 ATP and 2 NAD+

# 11/9

- Only red blood cells have no mitochondria
- Skeletol muscle cells can to aerobic or anaerobic respiration
    - In case of emergency, they can switch to anaerobic respiration
- Latic acid makes muscles sore
    - Acidic (low pH)
    - Liver can convert it back into a sugar
- Pyruvate is a junction between glycolysis and the Krebs cycle or fermentation

## Glycolysis

- Glycolysis can accept a range of carbohydrates
    - Polysaccharides (starch, glycogen) can be hydrolyzed into glucose monomer
    - Other hexoses (fructose, galactose) can be modified to undergo glycolysis
- Protiens and fats can also enter respiratory pathways
- Carbohydrates, fats, and protiens can all be catabolized through the same pathways
- ![Other Things In Respiration](./Photos/OtherThingsInRespiration.png)

## Regulation of respiration

- Rate of cartabolism is regulated by participants and level of ATP
    - If ATP drops, catabolism speeds up to make more
- Control of catabolism is based on regulating activity of eznyzmes at points in catabolic pathways
- ![Cellular Respiration Regulation](./Photos/CellularRespirationRegulation.png)

## Fermentation vs Respiration

- Fermentation
    - Glycolysis only
    - Cytoplasm
    - 2 ATP
    - Lactic acid or ethanol
- Respiration
    - Glycolysis + Krebs cycle + ETC
    - Cytoplasm + mitochondria
    - 36-38 ATP

## Photosynthesis vs respiration

- Photosynthesis
    - ATP from chemiosmosis
    - Not a lot of ATP
    - Builds G3P (for glucose)
    - Reactants: CO2 + H2O
    - Products: O2 + C6H12O6 + H2O
- Respiration
    - ATP from chemiosmosis
    - Aerobic and anaerobic to make ATP
    - Breaks down glucose
    - Reactants: C6H12O6 + O2
    - Products: CO2 + H2O

## Evolution of energy conversion

- Anaerobic respiration
    - Little ATP
    - No O2
    - Small heterotrophs
- Photosynthesis - PSI
    - Little ATP
    - Used sunlight
    - No PSII (no spliting O2 and no ETC)
    - No Calvin cycle (no sugar)
- Photosynthesis - PSII
    - ATP with sunlight
    - PSII (P680) powerful enough to split H2O
        - Electron transport chain
        - Released O2

## Photosynthesis

- Trophs:
    - Authotrophs
        - Photoautotrophs
            - Use light/solar energy
        - Chemoautotrophs
            - Use chemicals (deep sea vents)
    - Heterotrophs
        - Eat other organisms
    - Detritivores
        - Eat dead organisms
- Visible light: 380-750 nm
    - Shorter wavelengths have more energy
- Chloroplast
    - Like mitochondria, likely evolved from a prokaryote
        - Own DNA
        - Double membrane
    - Have stacks of thylakoids (grana)
    - Stroma space between thylakoids
    - Stomata are like the mouth of the chloroplast
        - Open and close to let CO2 in and O2 out
        - Guard cells control stomata
            - Careful to not let too much water out
            - Must loss some water (transpiration)
- Equation:
    - 6CO2 + 12H2O + light energy &rarr; C6H12O6 + 6O2 + 6H2O
    - Endergonic (sunlight added)
    - Similar to respiration
        - The opposite
- Redox:
    - OIL RIG
        - Oxidation is loss of electrons
        - Reduction is gain of electrons
    - Reducing agent is the electron donor
    - Oxidizing agent is the electron acceptor
- 6CO2 for 1 glucose
- C3 Plants
    - Rice, wheat, soy
    - Hot days: stomata close
        - CO2 used, O2 builds up
    - Cooler nights: stomata open
- C4:
    - Sugarcane, corn
    - Light and dark reactions physically separated
        - Calvin cycle occurs in chloroplasts located in bundle sheath cells (near leaf veins)
    - Plant adaptation to outcompete C3 plants in bright/dry conditions
- CAM:
    - Cactus, succulents, pineapples
    - Light and dark reactions are seperated by time
        - Plants collect and store CO2 in the nighttime and use it during the day without opening stomata
    - Plant can survive in hot/dry conditions
- Photorespiration
    - Wasteful pathway that occurs when the Calvin cycle enzyme rubisco acts on oxygen rather than carbon dioxide
    - The majority of plants are C3 plants, which have no special features to combat photorespiration
    - C4 plants minimize photorespiration by separating initial CO2 fixation and the Calvin cycle in space, performing these steps in different cell types
    - Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) plants minimize photorespiration and save water by separating these steps in time, between night and day
