# Class Notes

## 8/19

- Structure/function relation starts are molecular level
    - 1 small difference in structure can impact the function
- Life requires only 25 of 100+ elements
    - 6 most common: SPONCH
        - Sulfur
        - Phosphorus
        - Oxygen
        - Nitrogen
        - Carbon
        - Hydrogen
    - Rest are called the trace elements
- Structure of atom:
    - Protons and neutrons in nucleus
    - Atomic number = number of protons
    - Atomic mass = protons + neutrons
    - Charge on proton: positive
    - Charge on electron: negative
    - Protons hold electrons by charge
        - Eletrons further away
    - Valence electrons: eletrons in outmost cell
    - Shells/orbits:
        - 2 eletrons in first
        - 8 eletrons in second
        - 8 electrons in third
    - **A filled valence shell is a happy shell**
        - Purpose of chemical reactions: fill valence shell
- Carbon
    - Atomic number: 6
    - Atomic mass: 12
    - Eletrons: 6
- Ionic bonds
    - Transfer of electrons
    - Example: NaCl
        - Na: 11 - 2, 8, *1*
        - Cl: 17 - 2, 8, *7*
        - The 1 from Na transfers to fill the 3rd shell of Cl
            - Na lost a negative: Na+
            - Cl gained a negative: Cl-
- Covalent bonds
    - Share electrons
        - Non-polar covalent bond: electrons shared equally
            - Example: O2
                - O: 8 - 2, *6*
                - Both O's share 2 electrons to fill the outer shell
        - Polar colavent bonds: not shared equally
            - Example: H2O
                - O has more electro negativity, shared more towards O

## 8/23

- Intra: within
- Inter: between
- Water:
    - Polar covalent bonds
    - O: slightly negative (δ-)
    - H: slightly positive (δ+)
    - Hydrogen bonds between O of one molecule and H of another molecule
        - Represented by a dotted line in diagrams
        - Ice less dense than water
    - Solid &rarr; liquid &rarr; gas = breaking hydrogen bonds

### Capillary action

- Water moves "shoots to roots"
- TACT:
    - **T**ranspiration: relase of water through **stomata** in leaves
    - **A**dhesion: water molecules "stick" to the cells of **xylem**
    - **C**ohesion: water molecules "stick" to each other via **hydrogen bonds**
    - **T**ension: force created on a **pulling** object
- **Osmosis** moves water from soil &rarr; roots &rarr; xylem
