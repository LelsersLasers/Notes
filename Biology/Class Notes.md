Membrane transport

### Diffusion

- Passive transport: no energy required
- Movement of molecules from high to low concentration
    - End up fairly equally spread out
- Simple diffusion
    - If a molecule is small and nonpolar, it can diffuse through the membrane
    - If the molecule is big, it can't fit slip through the membrane, but can go through a channel
- Facilitated diffusion
    - If the molecule is big or polar, it might need help getting through the membrane
        - Goes through a carrier molecule
    - Uniport: one molecule going one direction
    - Symport: two molecules going one direction
    - Antiport: one molecule going one direction, a different going the other direction
- ![Passive Transport](./Photos/PassiveTransport.png)

#### Osmosis

- Diffusion of water across a membrane
- Phospholipid bilayer is always in motion (fluid)
    - Gaps open
- Water is polar, but is small enough to slip through the membrane

        - In addition to the normal diffusion
    - Usually always open

#### Tonic

- Solvent: dissolver

- Tonic: solute
- Hypotonic: less solute outside the cell than inside the cell
    - Water will move into the cell
    - Cell will swell (and possibly burst, but not for plant cells)
- Isotonic: equal solute outside the cell than inside
    - No net movement of water (water moves in and out at the same rate)
    - Cell stays the same size
- Hypertonic: more solute outside the cell than inside
    - Water moves out of the cell
    - Cell shrinks
- ![Tonic](./Photos/Tonic.png)
