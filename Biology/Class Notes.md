# Class Notes

## 8/19

- Structure/function relation starts are molecular level
    - 1 small difference in structure can impact the function
- Life requires only 25 of 100+ elements
    - 6 most common: SPONCH
        - Sulfur
        - Phosphorus
        - Oxygen
        - Nitrogen
        - Carbon
        - Hydrogen
    - Rest are called the trace elements
- Structure of atom:
    - Protons and neutrons in nucleus
    - Atomic number = number of protons
    - Atomic mass = protons + neutrons
    - Charge on proton: positive
    - Charge on electron: negative
    - Protons hold electrons by charge
        - Eletrons further away
    - Valence electrons: eletrons in outmost cell
    - Shells/orbits:
        - 2 eletrons in first
        - 8 eletrons in second
        - 8 electrons in third
    - **A filled valence shell is a happy shell**
        - Purpose of chemical reactions: fill valence shell
- Carbon
    - Atomic number: 6
    - Atomic mass: 12
    - Eletrons: 6
- Ionic bonds
    - Transfer of electrons
    - Example: NaCl
        - Na: 11 - 2, 8, *1*
        - Cl: 17 - 2, 8, *7*
        - The 1 from Na transfers to fill the 3rd shell of Cl
            - Na lost a negative: Na+
            - Cl gained a negative: Cl-
- Covalent bonds
    - Share electrons
        - Non-polar covalent bond: electrons shared equally
            - Example: O2
                - O: 8 - 2, *6*
                - Both O's share 2 electrons to fill the outer shell
        - Polar colavent bonds: not shared equally
            - Example: H2O
                - O has more electro negativity, shared more towards O

## 8/23

- Intra: within
- Inter: between
- Water:
    - Polar covalent bonds
    - O: slightly negative (δ-)
    - H: slightly positive (δ+)
    - Hydrogen bonds between O of one molecule and H of another molecule
        - Represented by a dotted line in diagrams
        - Ice less dense than water
    - Solid &rarr; liquid &rarr; gas = breaking hydrogen bonds
- Acid:
    - Chemical compound that **dontes** H+ to solutions
    - More acidic &rarr; higher [H+] &rarr; lower pH
- Base:
    - Chemical compound that **accepts** H+ from solutions
    - More basic &rarr; lower [H+] &rarr; higher pH
- `pH = 1/[H+]`
    - `pH 4 = 0.00001 = 10^-4 mol/l`

### Capillary action

- Water moves "shoots to roots"
- TACT:
    - **T**ranspiration: release of water through **stomata** in leaves
    - **A**dhesion: water molecules "stick" to the cells of **xylem**
    - **C**ohesion: water molecules "stick" to each other via **hydrogen bonds**
    - **T**ension: force created on a **pulling** object
- **Osmosis** moves water from soil &rarr; roots &rarr; xylem

## 8/24

- Isomers
    - Big, complex
    - Made from SPONCH
- Organic:
    - Carbon based
- From SPONCH
    - Carbohydrates (sugars, strarches)
    - Lipids and phospholipids (fats, oils, waxes, some steroids)
    - Proteins (enzymes and some steroids)
    - Nucleic acids (DNA, RNA)
        - MRNA: message RNA
        - DNA: the boss, sends info to RNA
        - RNA: makes the proteins
- Carbon
    - Tetravalent: 4 valence electrons
        - Compatible with many elements (especially SPONCH)
        - **Must form 4 covalent bonds**
    - Forms single of double bonds
 
 ### Diagramming

 - Single line: covalent bond
 - Double line: 2 covalent bonds

 ### Functional groups

- Replace an H on the the carbon skeleton

```
Hydroxyl group (alcohol) "-OH"
Carbonyl group (aldehyde or ketone) "C=O"
Carboxyl group (carboxylic acid) "-COOH"
    (H+ can break off - weak acid)
Amino group (amines) "-NH2"
Sulfhydryl group (thiols) "-SH"
Phosphate group "H3PO4"
```
