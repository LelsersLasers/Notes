# Class Notes

## 8/19

- Structure/function relation starts are molecular level
    - 1 small difference in structure can impact the function
- Life requires only 25 of 100+ elements
    - 6 most common: SPONCH
        - Sulfur
        - Phosphorus
        - Oxygen
        - Nitrogen
        - Carbon
        - Hydrogen
    - Rest are called the trace elements
- Structure of atom:
    - Protons and neutrons in nucleus
    - Atomic number = number of protons
    - Atomic mass = protons + neutrons
    - Charge on proton: positive
    - Charge on electron: negative
    - Protons hold electrons by charge
        - Eletrons further away
    - Valence electrons: eletrons in outmost cell
    - Shells/orbits:
        - 2 eletrons in first
        - 8 eletrons in second
        - 8 electrons in third
    - **A filled valence shell is a happy shell**
        - Purpose of chemical reactions: fill valence shell
- Carbon
    - Atomic number: 6
    - Atomic mass: 12
    - Eletrons: 6
- Ionic bonds
    - Transfer of electrons
    - Example: NaCl
        - Na: 11 - 2, 8, *1*
        - Cl: 17 - 2, 8, *7*
        - The 1 from Na transfers to fill the 3rd shell of Cl
            - Na lost a negative: Na+
            - Cl gained a negative: Cl-
- Covalent bonds
    - Share electrons
        - Non-polar covalent bond: electrons shared equally
            - Example: O2
                - O: 8 - 2, *6*
                - Both O's share 2 electrons to fill the outer shell
        - Polar colavent bonds: not shared equally
            - Example: H2O
                - O has more electro negativity, shared more towards O
