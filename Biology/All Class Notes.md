## 9/21

Membrane transport

### Diffusion

- Passive transport: no energy required
- Movement of molecules from high to low concentration
    - End up fairly equally spread out
- Simple diffusion
    - If a molecule is small and nonpolar, it can diffuse through the membrane
    - If the molecule is big, it can't fit slip through the membrane, but can go through a channel

        - Held in shape by hydrogen bonds
    - Substrate is now bound to the enzyme

# 10/7

## Enzyme regulation

- Allosteric site
    - Not the active site
    - But if something (allosteric effecteur) goes into a allosteric site, the shape of the active site changes
        - Can "shut off"/inhibite the active site and thus the enzyme
- Non-competitive (allosteric) inhibition
    - The inhibitor binds to the allosteric site
        - Changes the shape of the active site
        - Prevents the substrate from binding
    - Also part of the inhibitor could litterally block the active site
        - (But the inhibitor is binded on the allosteric site, not the active site)
- Competitive inhibition
    - The substrate competes with the inhibitor for the same active site
    - Litterally blocks the substrate from attaching to active site
- ![Enzyme Inhibitation](./Photos/EnzymeInhibition.png)
- Enzymes like optimal conditions
    - Usually don't like: high temperature, low pH
    - Salt concentration, and other environmental variables can also effect it
- Some enzymes are built, but require cofactors/coenzymes to turn on/activate/function
    - Cofactor
        - Inorganic (not carbon based)
    - Coenzyme
        - Organic
- Gene regulation
    - Don't build enzymes until they are needed
- Feedback inhibition
    - The product of a pathway inhibits an earlier enzyme in the pathway
    - Prevents the pathway from continuing
        - Prevents the cell from wasting energy/resources/space
    - ![Enzyme Feedback inhibition](./Photos/EnzymeFeedbackInhibition.jpg)

        - Hungry for electrons
            - NADP+ + 2e- + 2H &rarr; NADPH
- If the cell runs out of ATP or NADPH, it will stop the calvin cycle
    - The cell will store up ATP/NADPH from the sun and but the calvin cycle will run as long as there is ATP/NADPH

## Light dependant reactions

### Bridge reaction

- Pyruvate into the mitochondria matrix
    - Requires sufficient oxygen
- Pyruvate &rarr; acetyl CoA
    1. 1 CO2 out
    2. 1 NADH out
    3. Uses Coenzyme A ("CoA")

### Krebs cycle

- Mitochondria
    - Matrix
- Completes oxidation of organic fuel into CO2
    - Acetate from acetyl CoA + oxaloacetate &rarr; citrate
    - Oxaloacetate is recycled and acetate is broken down to CO2
- In:
    - Pyruvate from glucose
        - 2 per glucose
    - (CoA)
    - NAD+
    - FAD
    - ADP + Pi 
- Turns carbon bonds into energy and CO2
- Hyopxia = low oxygen
- Per pyruvate (2x for each glucose):
    - Bridge:
        - 1 CO2 out
        - 1 NADH out
    - Krebs:
        - 2 CO2 out
        - 3 NADH out
        - 1 FADH2 out
        - 1 ATP out
    - Result:
        - NADH and FADH2 &rarr; oxidative phosphorylation
        - CO2 follows gradient to go away
        - ATP (already used)

### Electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation

- ![Electron transport chain](https://cdn.kastatic.org/ka-perseus-images/0ff21c52cd544c8a51014fcbbc2ec144f32cd698.png)
- Mitochondria
    - The folds
    - Cristae
- ATP
    - Chemiosmosis (oxidative phosphorylation)
    - Only 4 without this
        - 2 from glycolysis and 2 from krebs
    - Most comes from energy in the electrons of NADH and FADH2
        - Powers moves H+ to power ATP synthase
- ATP synthase
    - Powered by H+ moving with the gradient
        - Works by spinning to turn ADP + Pi into ATP
    - "Oxidative phosphorylation"
    - NADH &rarr; 3ish ATP
        - 10 NADH &rarr; 30ish ATP
    - FADH2 &rarr; 2ish ATP
        - 2 FADH2 &rarr; 4ish ATP
- Oxygen = final electron acceptor
    - Oxygen will take electrons in any "form"
    - Electrons lose a bit of energy when they are passed down the chain to move H+

### Overall

- C6H12O6 + 6O2 + 6H2O &rarr; 6CO2 + 12H2O + energy
    - 60% of energy is released as heat
    - 34-36x (ADP + P &rarr; ATP)
- ![Cellular Respiration ATP](./Photos/CellularRespirationATP.png)

### Anaerobic respiration

- Glycolysis makes 2 ATP with (`aerobic`) or without (`anaerobic`) oxygen
- Without oxygen, various fermentation pathways generate ATP and recycle NAD+
    - Needs NAD+ to continue glycolysis
- Alcohol fermentation
    - Pyruvate into ethanol
    - 2x pyruvate &rarr; 2x acetaldehyde + 2x CO2 &rarr; 2x ethanol
- Lactic acid fermentation
    - Pyruvate is reduced directly by NADH into lactate
    - Muscle cells switch from aerobic to anaerobic respiration when oxygen is low
        - Creating "burning" sensation
        - Allows for a little more energy to be made
        - Latic acid eventually goes to liver
- Makes 2 ATP and 2 NAD+

# 11/9

- Only red blood cells have no mitochondria
- Skeletol muscle cells can to aerobic or anaerobic respiration
    - In case of emergency, they can switch to anaerobic respiration
- Latic acid makes muscles sore
    - Acidic (low pH)
    - Liver can convert it back into a sugar
- Pyruvate is a junction between glycolysis and the Krebs cycle or fermentation

## Glycolysis

- Glycolysis can accept a range of carbohydrates
    - Polysaccharides (starch, glycogen) can be hydrolyzed into glucose monomer
    - Other hexoses (fructose, galactose) can be modified to undergo glycolysis
- Protiens and fats can also enter respiratory pathways
- Carbohydrates, fats, and protiens can all be catabolized through the same pathways
- ![Other Things In Respiration](./Photos/OtherThingsInRespiration.png)

## Regulation of respiration

- Rate of cartabolism is regulated by participants and level of ATP
    - If ATP drops, catabolism speeds up to make more
- Control of catabolism is based on regulating activity of eznyzmes at points in catabolic pathways
- ![Cellular Respiration Regulation](./Photos/CellularRespirationRegulation.png)

## Fermentation vs Respiration

- Fermentation
    - Glycolysis only
    - Cytoplasm
    - 2 ATP
    - Lactic acid or ethanol
- Respiration
    - Glycolysis + Krebs cycle + ETC
    - Cytoplasm + mitochondria
    - 36-38 ATP

## Photosynthesis vs respiration

- Photosynthesis
    - ATP from chemiosmosis
    - Not a lot of ATP
    - Builds G3P (for glucose)
    - Reactants: CO2 + H2O
    - Products: O2 + C6H12O6 + H2O
- Respiration
    - ATP from chemiosmosis
    - Aerobic and anaerobic to make ATP
    - Breaks down glucose
    - Reactants: C6H12O6 + O2
    - Products: CO2 + H2O

## Evolution of energy conversion

- Anaerobic respiration
    - Little ATP
    - No O2
    - Small heterotrophs
- Photosynthesis - PSI
    - Little ATP
    - Used sunlight
    - No PSII (no spliting O2 and no ETC)
    - No Calvin cycle (no sugar)
- Photosynthesis - PSII
    - ATP with sunlight
    - PSII (P680) powerful enough to split H2O
        - Electron transport chain
        - Released O2

## Photosynthesis

- Trophs:
    - Authotrophs
        - Photoautotrophs
            - Use light/solar energy
        - Chemoautotrophs
            - Use chemicals (deep sea vents)
    - Heterotrophs
        - Eat other organisms
    - Detritivores
        - Eat dead organisms
- Visible light: 380-750 nm
    - Shorter wavelengths have more energy
- Chloroplast
    - Like mitochondria, likely evolved from a prokaryote
        - Own DNA
        - Double membrane
    - Have stacks of thylakoids (grana)
    - Stroma space between thylakoids
    - Stomata are like the mouth of the chloroplast
        - Open and close to let CO2 in and O2 out
        - Guard cells control stomata
            - Careful to not let too much water out
            - Must loss some water (transpiration)
- Equation:
    - 6CO2 + 12H2O + light energy &rarr; C6H12O6 + 6O2 + 6H2O
    - Endergonic (sunlight added)
    - Similar to respiration
        - The opposite
- Redox:
    - OIL RIG
        - Oxidation is loss of electrons
        - Reduction is gain of electrons
    - Reducing agent is the electron donor
    - Oxidizing agent is the electron acceptor
- 6CO2 for 1 glucose
- C3 Plants
    - Rice, wheat, soy
    - "Regular plants"
        - No counter photorespiration
    - Hot days: stomata close
        - CO2 used, O2 builds up
    - Cooler nights: stomata open
- C4:
    - Sugarcane, corn
    - Light and dark reactions physically separated
        - Calvin cycle occurs in chloroplasts located in bundle sheath cells (near leaf veins)
            - Bundle sheath cells area has no affinity for O2
    - Plant adaptation to outcompete C3 plants in bright/dry conditions
- CAM:
    - Cactus, succulents, pineapples
    - Light and dark reactions are seperated by time
        - Plants collect and store CO2 in the nighttime and use it during the day without opening stomata
            - CO2 converted to something else
    - Plant can survive in hot/dry conditions
- Photorespiration
    - Wasteful pathway that occurs when the Calvin cycle enzyme rubisco acts on oxygen rather than carbon dioxide
    - Happens more when stomata are closed
        - O2 build up
    - The majority of plants are C3 plants, which have no special features to combat photorespiration
    - C4 plants minimize photorespiration by separating initial CO2 fixation and the Calvin cycle in space, performing these steps in different cell types
    - Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) plants minimize photorespiration and save water by separating these steps in time, between night and day

# 11/28

- DNA &rarr; (transcription) RNA &rarr; (translation) protein
    - mRNA
    - Nucleotides &rarr; Nucleotides &rarr; amino acids
- DNA does not leave the nucleus
    - Needs ribosomes to make protein (and they are not in the nucleus)
        - Need to build a messenger molecule: mRNA (transcription)
    - The mRNA is "read" for polypeptide chains (proteins) to be assembled on ribosomes
- ![Transcription And Translation](./Photos/TranscriptionAndTranslation.png)
    - Note the 5' to 3' RNA while the DNA is 3-5

## RNA

- RNA is ribonucleic acid
    - DNA is deoxyribonucleic acid
- It contains ribose instead of deoxyribose
    - DNA has 1 less oxygen
- It is typically a single-stranded molecule
- It has URACIL instead of THYMINE

## Genetic code

- The Triplet Code:
    - Three-letter "words" on the DNA
    - CODON: on mRNA
    - ANTICODON: on tRNA
        - Pattern that is the opposite of the codon on the mRNA
- Appropriate amino Acids are biochemically attracted to the other end of the tRNA

### Important codons ("words") on mRNA

- Start: AUG
- Stop: UAA, UGA, UAG

## Transcription

- Occurs in the **nucleus**
- **RNA polymerase** opens DNA to expose a gene
- A gene is simply a “recipe” of a long sequence of DNA base-pairs
- DNA is opened at the **promotor** region
- The gene ends at the **terminator** region
- Therefore, mRNA is made by literally copying the gene
    - Complementary copy
        - Ex: C &rarr; G
- Before the mRNA can leave the nucleus, finishing touches must be made
- 3 phases of transcription:
    - Initiation
        - RNA polymerase binds to the promotor region
        - RNA polymerase unwinds the DNA
        - RNA polymerase begins to make a complementary copy of the gene
    - Elongation
        - RNA polymerase continues to make a complementary copy of the gene
    - Termination
        - RNA polymerase reaches the terminator region
        - RNA polymerase releases the mRNA
        - mRNA leaves the nucleus
- ![Transcription 3 Phases](./Photos/Transcription3Phases.png)
    - Note the 5-3 directions
        - The DNA side that is "read" to make the RNA (template strand): *antisense*
            - The RNA is complementary to the "read" strand
            - The other strand (nontemplate strand) is the *sense* strand (or coding strand)
                - Because the RNA is identical to the coding strand (other than T &rarr; U)
- Initiation of transcription for a  eukaryotic promoter:
    - ![Transcription Eukaryotic initialization](./Photos/TranscriptionEukaryotic.png)
- ![TranscriptionElongation](./Photos/TranscriptionElongation.png)
    - RNA nucleotides from what you eat or from recycled RNA
    - Direction the RNA is reading from: downstream

### mRNA

- ![mRNA](./Photos/mRNA.png)
    - Pic: after it is assembled and processed
- Special ends to slow down degradation
    - 5' Cap: G + 3 phosphates (methylguanine)
    - Poly-A tail: "buffer" of As
    - mRNA is temporary
        - Created when needed and should be destoyed when its down
        - But still should last long enough for translation
- Processing the mRNA transcript
    - Adding the methylguanine cap and Poly-A tail

#### pre-mRNA (primary transcript, "rough draft")

- DNA &rarr; pre-mRNA &rarr; mRNA
- ![mRNA Intron Exon](./Photos/mRNAIntronExon.png)
    - Exon: 'ex' = expressed = viewed = used
    - The same DNA will make the same pre-RNA
    - This step allow the same DNA to be used to make multiple different mRNA (and thus multiple different proteins)
- ![Splicosome](./Photos/pre-mRNA.png)
    - The intron pieces are not used for translation
        - Are sent away to be recycled
    - Finished mRNA is sent to the cytoplasm for translation
    - snRNPs: small nuclear ribonucleoproteins 

## Translation

- ![Translation](./Photos/translation.png)
- 3 sites within the ribose:
    - E: *e*xit
        - "Empty" tRNA leaves
            - "Drops off" the amino acid
    - P: binding (*p*eptidylt-tRNA binding site)
        - Where the *p*olypeptide chain is being build
    - A: entry (*a*rrival)
        - Single amino acids come in
- Codons: "3 letter words"
- Ribosome uses all 3 types of RNA:
    - mRNA: messenger RNA
        - "Instructions" for the protein
    - tRNA: transfer RNA
        - Transfers amino acids
        - The type of tRNA used in translation can only hold on to a single amino acid
            - The amino acid depends on the tRNA (anticodon)
            - Charging the tRNA:
                - ![tRNA](./Photos/tRNA.png)
                    - The 3 dangling bits on the tRNA are the anticodon
                - Uses ATP to build it
                    - The energy is released when the amino acid is broken off at A site
    - rRNA: ribosomal RNA
        - Make up ribosomes
- ![Ribosome](./Photos/ribosome.png)
    - Starts reading from the 3' side

### Initalization of Translation 

- ![Initalization Of Translation](./Photos/InitalizationOfTranslation.png)
- Ribosome attaches to the start codon (AUG) of the mRNA
- An initiation complex forms where the small subunit combines with mRNA, and initiator tRNA attaches with its amino acid

### Elongation of Translation

- ![Translation Elongation](./Photos/TranslationElongation.png)
- Endergonic
    - Requires energy to slide to read the next codon ("word")

### Termination of Translation

- ![Translation Termination](./Photos/TranslationTermination.png)
1. Stops at an mRNA stop codon by the binding of proteins
    - Release factors: the last tRNA does not carry an amino acid, but these special proteins instead
        - Is unable to "pick up" the polypeptide chain that is built at the P site
2. The last tRNA is released from the ribosome and everything separates
    - Ribosome subunits break and are recycled
3. New polypeptide (protein) is released

### Overview of Translation

- Occurs in the cytoplasm & on ribosomes
- mRNA attaches to the ribosome
- INITIATION
    - “Start” codon is read
- ELONGATION
    - One at a time, amino acids are brought over to ribosomes by specific tRNA’s
    - Amino acids covalent bond to one another forming a polypeptide chain
- TERMINATION
    - A “stop” codon is read & terminates the process

## Transcription and translation overview

- ![Transcription And Translation Overview](./Photos/TranscriptionAndTranslationOverview.png)
- Triplet (DNA) &rarr; codon (mRNA) &rarr; anticodon (tRNA) &rarr; amino acid

# 11/29

## 5' and 3'

- DNA and RNA are *made* in its 5' to 3' direction
- The template strand *read* in its the 3' to 5' direction

## Eukaryotic vs. prokaryotic protein synthesis

- Prokaryotes don’t have nuclei, so they need not wait for mRNA to exit the nucleus
- Very little RNA processing in prokaryotes, so mRNA is translated very quickly
- Ribosomes attach to mRNA and protein synthesis begins before transcription is complete
- Both:
    - Many copies of the proteins can be made at a time from the same mRNA
        - Once one ribosome has moved along the mRNA, another can attach and do the same
        - Example - polyribosomes:
            - ![Polyribosome](./Photos/PolyRibosome.jpg)
- ![Eukaryotic vs. Prokaryotic](./Photos/TranscriptionTranslationProVEuk.png)

## Mutations

- ![Mutation](./Photos/PointMutation.png)
- Mutation: any change in the nucleotide sequence
- Transposable elements
    -  "jumping genes"
    - Sequences that move from one location on the genome to another
- Cause of mutations:
    - Radiation
        - Ex: from UV, x-rays, gamma rays, beta rays, etc
    - Carcinogens
        - Cancer causing agents
            - Spreads the mutations
        - All carcinogens are mutagens
        - Metastasis: the development of secondary malignant growths at a distance from a primary site of cancer
- Mutagen: something that causes/increases mutations
- Cells most at risk: those that divide more often
    - More chances to make a mistake
    - Ex: skin cells

### Point mutations

- ![Base Pair Substitution](./Photos/BasePairSubstitution.png)
- "Point": just thing 1 is changed/substituted
    - If it is on the DNA, then it will last and effect all the mRNA that is made from it
    - If it is on the mRNA, it only effects the proteins made on that 1 batch of proteins made from that mRNA
- Mutations occurring in DNA often show up during translation
- Base-pair substitution
    - A type of mutation involving replacement or substitution of a single nucleotide base with another in DNA or RNA molecule
        - 1 base is swapped for another
- **Wobble effect**:
    - During translation, often only the first 2 bases of the codon are used
        - 4^3 = 64, but only 20 amino acids
    - So, in many cases, if the 3rd base is changed, it could have no effect
- Missense: (a stop codon or an amino acid) &rarr; a different amino acid
- Nonsense: an amino acid &rarr; a stop codon

#### Sickle cell

- ![Sickle Cell](./Photos/SickleCell.png)
- Some (point mutation &rarr; amino acid switches) are not critical
- But in this example, the change is in an important structural part of the protein
    - Folds and shapes differently
        - Structure determins function

### Frameshift mutations

- ![Frameshift](./Photos/Frameshift.png)
- Insertion/deletion causes a **frameshift**
    - DNA and RNA is read in "frames"
        - 3 bases at a time
    - Adding or deleting 1 base will offset all the remaining bases
        - Could change all the amino acids
- If you delete or add a multiple of 3 bases, then there will be deleted or added amino acids
    - But the rest of the polypeptide chain will be unaffected

## Meiosis

### ASEXUAL REPRODUCTION

- ![Asexual Reproduction](./Photos/AsexualReproduction.jpg)
- ![Asexual Reproduction](./Photos/AsexualReproduction2.png)
- One parent alone produces offspring
- Offspring inherits same # of chromosomes (& genes on it)
- Theoretically, the offspring is a “clone” of its parent
- Binary fission
- Basically mitosis & cytokinesis (for eukaryotes)
- Gets genetic variation from mutations

### SEXUAL REPRODUCTION

Involves:
- Meiosis
- Production of gametes
    - Sex cells: sperm and egg
    - Haploid: 1 set of chromosomes
- Fertilization

### The Human Genome

- 23 pairs of chromosomes
    - Pairs 1-22: AUTOSOMAL chromosomes
        - 1 = biggest, 22 = smallest
    - Pair 23: SEX chromosomes
- Paired chromosomes-”HOMOLOGOUS” chromosomes
    - Homologous: relatively same size & shape
- Pair 23 different for males
    - Not homologous in males

### MEIOSIS

- ![Meiosis Overview](./Photos/MeiosisOverview.png)
- Occurs in germ cells
    - Germs cells (& somatic cells) are DIPLOIDS (2n)
        - For humans 2n = 46
    - Germ cells undergo meiosis to form gametes (sperm & egg)
- DIPLOID (2n) &rarr; HAPLOID (1n)
- 2 sets of cell division:
    - Meiosis I
    - Meiosis II

#### Meiosis I

- ![Meiosis I](./Photos/Meiosis1.png)
- 4 stages: 
    - Prophase I
        - Same as mitosis + some other steps
        - Synapsis: homologous chromosomes pair up
            - Homologous = similar/matching
                - Have same gene in same location (but not necessarily same alleles)
            - Tetrad: 4 sister chromatids
                - 2 homologous chromosomes
        - Crossing over: homologous chromosomes exchange/swap genetic material
            - Happens only on "inside" chromatids
                - Will retain 1 unaltered chromatids
            - Creates genetic variation
    - Metaphase I
    - Anaphase I
    - Telophase I
- 1x Diploid (2n) &rarr; 2x Haploid (1n)
    - Double the number of chromosomes

#### Meiosis II

- ![Meiosis II](./Photos/Meiosis2.png)
- Basically the same as mitosis
- 4 stages: 
    - Prophase II
    - Metaphase II
    - Anaphase II
    - Telophase II
- 2x Haploid (1n) &rarr; 4x Haploid (1n)
    - Split sister chromatids
- At the end of meiosis II, four daughter cells are produced
    - Each of these resulting daughter cells is haploid

# 11/30

## Meiosis

### Mitosis vs. Meiosis

- ![Mitosis vs. Meiosis](./Photos/MitosisVsMeiosis.png)
- Similar
    - Both started with diploid cells
        - In humans: 46 chromosomes
    - Both make new cells (and divide)
    - Similar prophase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase, cytokinesis
- Different
    - Mitosis: 1 cell &rarr; 2 diploid cells
        - Meiosis: 1 cell &rarr; 4 haploid cells
    - Mitosis: daughter cells are identical to parent cell
        - Meiosis: daughter cells are not identical to parent cell or each other

### Independent assortment

- ![Independent Assortment](./Photos/IndependentAssortment.png)
- During meiosis I, homologous chromosomes line up randomly
- Independent assortment
    - The way one chromosome lines up has no effect on the way the other chromosome lines up
```
n = number of pairs of chromosomes
2^n = number of possible combinations just by independent assortment
humans: 2^23 = 8,388,608
but because 2 people are involved it is actually (2^23)^2
and there is almost infinite possible cross over combinations
result: basically infinite possible combinations
```

### Crossing over

- ![Crossing Over](./Photos/CrossingOver.png)
- During prophase I, homologous chromosomes exchange genetic material
- Crossing-Over
    - Occurs when homologous chromosomes “cross-over” one another and “swap” some DNA
    - Leads to variation in gametes

### Gametogenesis

- ![Gametogenesis](./Photos/Gametogenesis.jpg)
- Females are born with them, but males constantly make them
- Oogenesis
    - Unequal
        - 1 egg with a lot of cytoplasm and 3 small discarded polar bodies
    - Only 1 sperm can fertilize the egg
        - ![Egg](./Photos/Egg.png)
        - Sperm + egg = zygote

##  Chromosomes vs chromatids

| | Chromosome | Chromatid | |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :- |
| G1 | 2n | 2n | interphase status - chromatids = chromosomes |
| G2 | 2n | 4n | replicated the DNA | 
| After M1 | n | 2n | split into 2 haploid daughter cells (+ cross over happens) |
| After M2 | n | n | sister chromatids split into 2 haploid daughter cells |

## Gene Regulation

- Is the gene affecting stuff?
    - Is it expressed?
- Some cells have common genes
    - Some cells have unique genes

### Bacterial Reproduction

- No meiosis occurs and there is no fertilization
- Sometimes bacteria reproduce via cloning (like mitosis) or asexual means
    - Makes exact copies
- But if bacterial DNA is changed, there are four ways:
    - Mutation, transformation, transduction, or conjugation

#### Bacterial Transformation

- The alteration of a bacterial cell’s genotype and phenotype by the uptake of naked, foreign DNA from the surrounding environment
    - Genotype:
        - The alleles of a gene
            - What version of the gene
        - Ex: "Bb"
            - (Think the punit squares from 7th grade)
    - Phenotype:
        - Expression of the gene
        - Ex: blue eyes
- When bateria die, the cell wall decays and the cytoplasm sort of leaks out
    - Other living bacteria can take up the DNA
        - "Slurps" it up
- ![Bacterial Transformation](./Photos/BaterialTransformation.png)

#### Bacterial Transduction

- Phages carry bacterial genes from one host cell to another
    - Phages:
        - Viruses that infect and replicate only in bacterial cells
- The phages covelantly bond (chemically attracted)
    - The viruses use bateria to reproduce
    - The bateria explodes and the viruses are released and spread
    - However, sometimes the host DNA from the bateria is also spread
        - Packaged with (or instead of) the virus
- ![Bacterial Transduction](./Photos/BacterialTransduction.png)

#### Bacterial Mutation

- Mutations occur at the same rate as in humans
    - But they reproduce much much more than humans
        - Up to once every 20 minutes

#### Bacterial Conjugation

- Direct transfer of genetic material between two bacterial cells that temporarily join
- Under some conditions, certain bateria will form a Pilus
    - The bateria sends partial copies of its DNA across
- Random:
    - What DNA is is copied and sent
    - How long the connection remains
- ![Bacterial Conjugation](./Photos/BacterialConjugation.png)
    - Baterial DNA is in rings
        - 1 big main ring and smaller rings of extra DNA(plasmids)
- ![F plasmid](./Photos/Fplasmid.jpg)
    - F: fertility
        - F+ = can transfer DNA
        - F- = cannot transfer DNA
    - R: resistance
        - Survival of the fittest
            - Bateria that can survive the antibiotic will survive and reproduce

### Gene Control

- Why is it important to be able to control the expression of genes?
    - 
- Regulatory Proteins
    - Intervene before, during & after gene transcription
    - Some genes build proteins that regulate other genes
    - Negative Control: “repressors”
        - Slows activity – typical of anabolic pathways
    - Positive Control: “activators”
        - Promote or enhance activity
            - Initiate certain actions/genes
        - Growth factors
        - Examples of positive control:
            - Promotors-signal start of a gene
            - Enhancers-binding sites for activator proteins

#### Gene Control in E. coli

- Genes are typically grouped together in succession
    - Only 1 chromosome (compared to 23 in humans)
- Promoter Region:
    - RNA polymerase must attach here to start transcription
- Operator Region:
    - Near promoter region, site for controlling transcription
- Operon:
    - Promoter, operator, and associated genes
    - Ex: TRP, LAC
- Regulatory Gene:
    - Codes for the repressor protein
- Repressor:
    - Blocks transcription by binding to the operator region (ex. tryptophan)
- 3 Important genes in LAC operon:
    - Lac Z &rarr; ß-galactosidase
    - Lac Y &rarr; Permease
    - Lac A &rarr; Transacetylase

# 12/8

## Operons

### TRP operon

- TRP: tryptophan
    - An amino acid
- Represible operon: on until turned off
- ![TRP Operon](./Photos/TRPOperon.png)
    - Something &rarr; enzymes &rarr; tryptophan
    - Feedback inhibition
        - Stop when enough tryptophan is made

#### TRP Operon: On

- ![TRP Operon On](./Photos/TRPOperonOn.png)
- Repressor protein binds to the operator
    - Blocks RNA polymerase from binding/moving forward
- Repressible operon
    - Transcription is usually on but can be inhibited if tryptophan binds to a regulatory protein
- Takes energy to build it
    - So only build it when wanted
    - Anabolic pathway (building something)

#### TRP Operon: Off

- ![TRP Operon Off](./Photos/TRPOperonOff.png)

### LAC Operon

- LAC: lactose
    - A sugar
- Inducible operon: off until turned on
    - Is usually off but can be induced when a specific molecule interacts with a regulatory protein
    - Catabolic pathway (breaking something down)
        - Turned on when trying to digest something

#### LAC Operon: Off

- ![LAC Operon Off](./Photos/LACOperonOff.png)

#### LAC Operon: On

- ![LAC Operon On](./Photos/LACOperonOn.png)

## Operon summary

- Repressible enzymes
    - Suspend production of an end product when it is in sufficient quantity
        - Normally “on” (tryptophan pathway)
            - On until turned off
    - These enzymes are typical of anabolic pathways
        - Saving energy by not producing products that are already present
- Inducible enzymes
    - Their synthesis is induced by a chemical signal
        - Normally “off” (lactose pathway).
            - Off until turned on
    - These enzymes are typical of catabolic pathways
        - Saving energy/resources and not producing proteins that are not currently necessary
- Both are examples of negative control of genes
    - The operons are switched off by the active form of the repressor protein

### Eukaryotic gene expression is regulated at many stages

- All organisms must regulate which genes are expressed at any given time
- In multicellular organisms regulation of gene expression is essential for cell specialization

## Differential Gene Expression

- Almost all the cells in an organism are **genetically** identical
    - Somatic cells
- Differences between cell types result from **differential gene expression**
    - The expression of different genes by cells with the same genome
- Abnormalities in gene expression can lead to diseases including cancer
- Gene expression **can be** regulated at many stages

### Regulated/changed/etc at different places, times

- ![Differential Gene Expression](./Photos/DifferentialGeneExpression.png)
- ![Differential Gene Expression 2](./Photos/DifferentialGeneExpression2.png)
- Alternative splicing
    - Rearranging the exons in the pre-mRNA

## Effects on mRNAs by MicroRNAs and Small Interfering RNAs

- MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small single-stranded RNA molecules that can bind to mRNA
    - Match base pairs (like codon-anticodon) but instead block the mRNA from being translated
    - Or speed up the degradation of the mRNA
- Another way of regulating and changing the expression from DNA &rarr; protein
- ![miRNA](./Photos/miRNA.png)
- The phenomenon of inhibition of gene expression by RNA molecules is called RNA interference (RNAi)
- RNAi is caused by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs)
- siRNAs and miRNAs are similar but form from different RNA precursors
    - Both can associate with the same proteins, resulting in similar results

## Genetic changes that can turn proto-oncogenes into oncogenes

- Proto-oncogenes
    - Normal genes that can become oncogenes if mutated
        - Tumor, unregulated cell growth/division
    - Rapid cell division
        - Important for growth and development
- ![Proto-oncogenes](./Photos/Proto-oncogenes.png)

### Oncogenes and the Cell Cycle

- Proto-oncogene vs. oncogenes
    - Proto-oncogens: regulated
    - Oncogenes: unregulated

#### RAS

- RAS gene makes RAS protein
    - A class of small protein called GTPase involved in cellular signal transduction
    - Normally “off” without proper growth factor
- Mutations in RAS gene keep signaling active, resulting in overactive cell growth and division
- 30% of all human cancers have Ras mutations and inhibitors are being studied
- ![RAS](./Photos/RAS.jpg)
    - Growth factor: signal to start cell division
        - Ex: cut on skin &rarr; make more skin cells
    - RAS mutations cause the cells to ignore the check points
        - Allows the creation of bad cells (at a high rate)

#### p53

- The p53 gene codes for a tumor suppressor protein
- Anti-cancer functions
    - Inhibiting cell cycle at the G1/S checkpoint if DNA is damaged and can be repaired
    - Can initiate apoptosis if DNA cannot be repaired
- Mutation(s) in p53 can allow damaged DNA to be passed to daughter cells during mitosis
    - HPV (human papilloma virus) can inactivate p53, leading to cervical cancer (e.g., Henrietta Lacks)
- ![p53](./Photos/p53.png)

## The Multistep Model of Cancer Development

- Multiple mutations are generally needed for full-fledged cancer
    - Thus the incidence increases with age
- At the DNA level, a cancerous cell is usually characterized by at least one active oncogene and the mutation of several tumor-suppressor genes
    - Too much gas and no brakes

### Inherited Predisposition and Other Factors Contributing to Cancer

- Individuals can inherit oncogenes or mutant alleles of tumor-suppressor genes
    - Ex: inherited mutations in the tumor-suppressor gene adenomatous polyposis coli are common in individuals with colorectal cancer
    - Ex: Mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene are found in at least half of inherited breast cancers and ovarian cancers can be tested for using DNA sequencing to detect these mutations

## Evolution

- Natural selection does not design, it tinkers
- Once a particular problem is solved, that solution is used over and over
- The harder the problem, the more universal the solution is

## Cell Signaling

- Signaling evolved early in history of life
1. “sex” and yeast mating strains
    - Cells cannot think
2. signal-transduction pathways
    - Process by which a signal on a cell’s surface is converted (probably originated in early prokaryotes)
- ![Yeast Signaling](./Photos/YeastSignaling.png)
    - Mom and dad combine

### Communicating cells may be close together or far apart

1. Paracine signaling
    - Short distances
    - Growth factors – non-specific)
2. Synaptic signaling
    - Short distances
    - Neurotransmitters – specific
    - Synapse: junction between two neurons
3. Hormone signaling
    - Long distances
4. Direct contact
    - Gap junctions (animals) and plasmodesmata (plants)
        - Spaces in the cell membrane/wall
    - Cell-to-cell communication
        - Some cells "dock" with other cells
            - Specific receptors
    - ![Direct Contact Signaling](./Photos/DirectContactSignaling.png)
- If a cell responds to a signal, it is called a target cell
- ![Cell Signaling](./Photos/CellSignaling.png)

### Stages of Cell Signaling

- Role of epinephrine in the breakdown of glycogen
    - Fight or flight response
- ![Stages of Cell Signaling](./Photos/StagesOfCellSignaling.png)
1. Reception
    - Target cell’s detection of outside signal
    - Conformational change in reception protein when a signal binds
        - Signal is often attracted to the reception protein
            - Chemical or charge based
2. Transduction
    - Conversion of signal to a form that can elicit a response
3. Response
    - Transduced signal triggers a specific response
        - Ex: epinephrine released to promote conversion of glycogen to glucose
            - Glycogen is in 100s-1000s of stored glucose molecules

#### Signal Reception and Transduction

- Signal binds to reception protein
- “Lock and key” specificity
    - "Structure determines function"
    - Reception protein is specific to the signal
- Ligand: a small molecule that specifically binds to another larger one
    - Doesn't last long
        - Don't want signals from years ago
            - Should be a quick reaction
    - Ligand binding results in change in shape of reception protein

### Types of Signal Receptors

1. G-protein linked receptors
2. tyrosine-kinase receptors (omit, not really important rn)
3. ion channel receptors
	- ligand-gated ion channels
	- example: synapses between neurons
4. Intracellular receptors
	- proteins located in cytoplasm or nucleus (in the cell), not membrane
	- e.g. lipids, steroid hormones
        - Things that can move through the cell membrane (diffusion)

#### G-protein linked receptors

- G-proteins embedded in cell membranes
- Many molecules use G-protein receptors
    - Yeast mating factors, epinephrine, hormones, and neurotransmitters
- Involves use of GDP and GTP
    - GDP: inactive
    - GTP: active

##### What G-proteins receptors do 

- Molecule binds to outside portion of receptor
- Either binding of molecule or subsequent change in molecule changes shape of receptor
- Shape change inside membrane changes association with a specific G-protein
- The G-protein goes off and does its job, whatever that might be
- ![G-protein](./Photos/G-protein.png)
    - If the GDP is on the G-protein, it is inactive ("off")
    - Signled to be active ("on") by the binding of GTP
    - G-protein goes to an enzyme and activates it
        - The enzyme then does its job
    - GTP replaced with GDP and the G-protein is inactive again
        - Goes back to the receptor and waits for another signal

##### Examples of how G-protein receptors are used

- Transduce light (photosynthesis and phototaxis)
- Receptors for sexual pheromones 
- Identify safe food
- Directional migration of cells
- Identify invaders
- Identify members of clan
- Receptors for peptide hormones
- Detect everything you smell

#### Ion channel receptors

- ![Ion Channel Receptors](./Photos/IonChannelReceptors.png)

#### Intracellular receptors

- ![Intracellular Receptors](./Photos/IntracellularReceptors.png)

### Signal Transduction Pathways

- Pathways involve protein interaction
- Protein phosphorylation (gets a phosphate)
	1. mechanism for regulating protein activity
	2. involves protein kinase
        - An enzyme which transfers phosphate from ATP to protein
	3. results in a cascade of reactions
- 2% of human DNA codes for kinases
- ![Signal Transduction Pathways](./Photos/SignalTransductionPathways.png)

# 1/6

- Heritable features: ”characters” - genes
- Variations of characters: ”traits” - alleles

## Terms

- Dominant (P_) vs. Recessive (pp): Complete Dominance
- Homozygous (PP or pp)
- Heterozygous (Pp)
- Phenotype (physical appearance of traits)
- Carrier: have but not expressed
- Genotype (actual alleles)
- Testcross (unknown genotypes- used to determine alleles)
- Dihybrid cross (looking at 2 traits)
- Incomplete Dominance (FRFW-pink flower)
- Codominance (FBFY-blue w/ yellow blotches)

## Breeds

- True-breeds: 2 copies of same allele
    - Different version of a gene
- Hybrids: Results when you cross 2 different true-breds
- ![Breeds](./Photos/Breeds.png)
- ![Genotype Vs Phenotype](./Photos/GenotypeVsPhenotype.png)
- ![Gametes and Breeds](./Photos/GametesBreeds.png)

## Dihybrid Crosses

- Two genes/traits involved

### Phenotype Ratios

| | S | s |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| S | SS | Ss |
| s | Ss | ss |

- In monohybrid crosses: 3:1

| | SY | sY | Sy | sy |

| SY | SSYY | SSYy | SsYY | SsYy |
| sY | SsYY | SsYy | ssYY | ssYy |
| Sy | SsYY | SsYy | ssYY | ssYy |
| sy | ssYY | ssYy | ssyy | ssyy |

- In dihybrid crosses: 9:3:3:1


## Mendel's Second Law

- The Principle of Independent Assortment
- Each pair of alleles segregates independently of each other pair of alleles during gamete formation
    - Rules apply only to genes on different chromosomes
- Heredity is determined by discrete physical elements for each trait (genes)

## Allele interactions

- Not always just dominate vs. recessive
- Incomplete dominance
    - Offspring have an intermediate (mixed) phenotype
    - Ex: Red (dominant) flower + white (recessive) flower = pink (incomplete dominance) flower
    - Notation:
        - (traitLetter)^(traitStatus)
    - Ratio: 1:2:1
        - Phenotypic ratio = genotypic ratio
- Codominance
    - Both alleles are expressed
    - 2 alleles affect the phenotype in different ways
    - Ex: Red (dominant) flower + white (recessive) flower = red and white (codominance) flower (ex: stripped)
- Multiple alleles
    - When there are more than 2 alleles in the population
    - Ex: blood type (codominance): A, B, AB, O
        - AA || AO: A
        - BB || BO: B
        - AB: AB
        - OO: O

## Pleiotropy inheritance

- When a single gene has multiple phenotypic effects
- Ex: cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia
- 1 genetic mutation/change can have 1+ of multiple phenotypic effects

## Polygenic inheritance

- An additive effect of two or more genes on a single phenotypic character
    - Gives a continuous bell curved variation
- Ex: human height, skin color

## Epistasis

- The phenotypic expression of a gene at one locus alters (masks) that of a gene at a second genetic location

# 1/10

## Heterozygous Advantage Hypothesis

- The heterozygote genotype has a higher relative "fitness" than either homozygous genotype
- AA: no sickle cell, susceptible to malaria
- Aa: mild sickle cell, resistant to malaria
    - Still compromising, but best of both options
- aa: severe/fatal sickle cell, resistant to malaria

## The Chromosomal Basis of Inheritance

- Mendel left us with “hereditary factors” 
- Now: genes located on chromosomes
- We can “see” a gene by tagging chromosomes with fluorescent dyes attached to complementary sequences

## Karyotype

- ![Human male karyotype](./Photos/MaleKaryotype.png)
- Chromosomes 1-22: autosomes
    - Homologous pairs
- Sex determination in humans
    - Female: XX
    - Male: XY
- Because sex chromosome don’t always come in homologous pairs, the genes they carry show unique, distinctive patterns of inheritance
- The X chromosome has MANY genes
    - Only some are involved in sex determination
- The Y-chromosome has 60-70 genes, about half of which are active only in the testes
    - The SRY gene acts as a “master switch”
        - It encodes a protein that turns on other genes required for male development
            - XX &rarr; no SRY &rarr; develop as female
            - XY &rarr; SRY &rarr; develop as male
- In males: X came from mom
    - Y came from dad

## X-linked genes

- When a gene is on the X-chromosome, but not the Y chromosome it is said to be X-linked
    - Ex: Human color-blindness is an X-linked trait
- Females: 
    - X*B*X*B* = dominant normal vision
    - X*B*X*b* = dominant normal vision
        - Carrier, heterozygous
    - X*b*X*b* = recessive color blind
- Males: 
    - X*B*Y = dominant normal vision
    - X*b*Y = recessive color blind
- X-linked diseases are much more common in men than they are in women
    - If a man has an affected X they have the disease (just needs 1 copy, even for recessive)!
    - ![X Linked](./Photos/XLinked.png)

## Fruit Flies

- ![Fruit Flies](./Photos/FruitFlies.png)
    - If the gene is X-linked and mom has the recessive phenotype (white eyes): ALL male offspring have white eyes and none of the females

## Genetic Linkage

### Independent/equal splits

- When genes are on separate chromosomes, or very far apart on the same chromosome, they assort independently
    - Gametes are exactly what you would expect from parent
    - Further apart: more crossing over
        - Approaches 50% split (like independent assortment) 
- ![Genetic Linkage](./Photos/GeneticLinkage.png)

### Linked

- When genes are very close together on the same chromosome instead of assorting independently, the genes tend to “stick together” during meiosis
    - The genes are linked
- ![Genetic Linkage](./Photos/GeneticLinkage2.png)
    - Now we see gamete types in very unequal proportions
    - Gametes more often look like their parents (parental gametes) but occasionally there was crossing over between the “a” and “b” gene resulting in recombinant gametes

## Recombinant Chromosomes

- ![Recombinant Chromosomes](./Photos/RecombinantChromosomes.png)
    - Crossing over between two genes that are far apart is very common
    - Crossing over between two genes that are close together is rare
- Thomas Hunt Morgan used this as a way to find the relative distance between genes on a chromosome
    - Tightly linked genes (genes very close to each other) will have very few recombination events, while unlinked genes (genes on separate chromosomes or very far part) will show a lot of recombination

### Calculating Recombination Frequency

- ??????????????????
- If you don't see the expected ratio: genes are linked
- ![Recombination Frequency](./Photos/RecombinantFlies.png)
- Measure the linkage by calculating recombination frequency
    - Recombination frequency = (recombinants / total offspring) * 100%

### Determing gene map

- A linkage map is a genetic map of a chromosome based on recombination frequencies
- Higher recombination frequency = farther apart
- ![Gene Map](./Photos/GeneMap.png)
    - The largest RF – outermost genes. 
    - The smallest RF – innermost genes. 
- Distances between genes can be expressed as map units: 1 map unit = 1 centiMorgan = 1% recombination

# 1/11

## X-Inactivation in Female Mammals

- But human females have two X-chromosomes (XX), while human males have just one (XY). 
- ![X-Inactivation](./Photos/X-Inactivation.png)

### X-Inactivation in Calico cats

- Here is a female cat heterozygous for black and tan alleles of a coat color gene found on the X-chromosome. 
- Random X-inactivation in different cells during development causes a tortoiseshell coat pattern. 
- ![X-Inactivation Cat](./Photos/X-InactivationCat.png)

## Nondisjunction (bad separation) during Meiosis

- Pairs are important in genetics!
    - If a chromosome pair loses or gains a member &rarr; trouble!
- Anueploidy: having an abnormal number of chromosomes (too many or too few!)
- ![Aneuoploid](./Photos/Aneuoploid.png)
    - Monosomy: missing a chromosome
    - Trisomy: extra chromosome (tri: 3 instead of 2)
- ![Aneuploidy](./Photos/Aneuploidy.png)

## Chromosomal Rearrangements

- Deletion: a part of a chromosome is removed or deleted
- Duplication: a part of a chromosome is copied
- Inversion: a chromosomal region is flipped around so that it points in the opposite direction
- ![Chromosomal Rearrangements](./Photos/ChromosomalRearrangements)

### Translocation

- A piece of a chromosome gets attached to another chromosome
- Reciprocal Translocation: involves two chromosomes swapping segments
- Non-Reciprocal Translocation: a chunk of one chromosome moves to another
- ![Translocation](./Photos/Translocation.png)

## Chi-square

- To test how likely it is that an observed distribution is due to chance
    - A "goodness of fit" statistic
    - It measures how well the observed distribution of data fits with the distribution that is expected
- When you collect data, is the variation in your data due to chance or is it due to something else? 
    -Ex: is your genetics expected or different due to gene linkage
- ![Chi-Square Equation](./Photos/Chi-SquareEquation.png)
    - `Oi` = observed values
        - What you actually got in expirements
    - `Ei` = expected values
        - What Mendelian genetics expects based on the total numbers
    - Sum: for everyone outcome (phenotype), run the calculation
- Goal: accept/reject the null hypothesis
    - Null hypothesis: there is no significant difference between the observed and expected frequencies

### Dihybrid

- Cross AaBa x AaBa
    - Ratio: 9:3:3:1
        - 9: double dominant (A?B?)
        - 3: recessive for a, dominant for B (aaB?)
        - 3: dominant for a, recessive for B (A?bb)
        - 1: double recessive (aabb)

### Chi-Square Table

- ![Chi-square table](./Photos/Chi-SquareTable.png)
- Degrees of Freedom: the degrees of freedom is the number of outcomes minus one
- Critical Values:
    - How certain we are of the data
    - We will use 0.05 value.
        - 0.05 = 5% chance of being wrong
    - If your # < critical value = ACCEPT null hypothesis 
    - If your # > critical value = REJECT null hypothesis
        - There is something going on (ex: linkage)

- Complementary Base Pairing and DNA ligase (glue)
- Gel Electrophoresis (separate pieces of DNA)
- Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR – make many copies of a piece DNA)
- DNA Sequencing (give up the sequence of base pairs)

#### Restriction Enzymes

- Restriction Enzymes cut DNA as specific sequences called **restriction sites**
    - Doesn't cut straight across
        - Often leaves single stranded overhanging “sticky ends”
    - "Blunt" ends: cut straight across
- Matches a specific sequence of 6-8 bases
    - The restriction site is a palindrome/flipped:
    - ![Restriction Enzymes](./Photos/RestrictionEnzyme3.png)
- ![Restriction Enzymes](./Photos/RestrictionEnzyme1.png)
- ![Restriction Enzymes](./Photos/RestrictionEnzyme2.png)
    - Two different pieces of DNA cut with the same enzyme can come together
    - Can glue different pieces of DNA with ligase

## Gene Cloning

- ![Gene Cloning](./Photos/GeneCloning.png)
- ![Gene Cloning](./Photos/GeneCloning2.png)
1. Cut “gene of interest” out of one organism & cut your plasmid
2. Put it into a plasmid
3. Transform bacteria (get plasmid inside)
4. Bacteria grows and copies plasmid (makes “clones” of your gene)

# 2/9

- Evolution: change over time
    - In bio: all the changes that have happened to life on earth since the first cell
- Descent with modification: all living things are related
    - All living things have parents
    - Next generation is slightly different from parents
    - Mutation creates the modification
    - = evolution
- Niche: unique role in the environment
    - Ex: prey, pollinator, predator, decomposer, etc
- Natural selection: organisms that are best suited to their environment survive and reproduce
    - Survival of the fittest/strongest
    - Fittest = best suited to the environment
    - If a modification is beneficial, it will be passed on to the  offspring
    - Mechanism of evolution
- Adaptation: inherited trait that increases an organism’s chance of survival
    - Ex: camouflage, mimicry, etc
- Transitional fossils: fossils that show the change from one species to another
    - Evidence of an "in-between" forms/species
        - Land mammal -> transitional -> whale
- Homologous structures: similar structures that have different function
    - Ex: human arm and whale flipper/cat leg/bat wing
- Vestigial structures: structures that have no current function
    - Ex: appendix, wisdom teeth, etc
- Convergent evolution: similar traits in unrelated species
    - Ex: wings on birds and bats
    - Similar selection pressures
- Analogous structures: similar structures that have the same function
    - Similar features found in different lineages.
    - Ex: wings on birds and bats
    - Shows convergence of function
- Embryology: study of embryos
    - Similarities in embryos of different species

## Darwin and finches/turtles/fossils

- Darwin traveled to the Galapagos Islands (and other places)
- Darwin noticed that the finches on the Galapagos Islands were different but similar
- Adaptation to their environment
    - Traits/features match the environment
- Noticed similarites between fossils and current living things

## Darwin influences

- Jean-Baptiste Lamarck (1744-1829)
    - Organisms on Earth have changed over time and that they are suited to particular environments
    - Use and disuse: use a body part and it will grow, don’t use it and it will shrink
        - Wrong
- Charles Lyell: Earth is really old
    - Bible might not be right on this one
- Georges Cuvier: Paleontology
- Thomas Malthus: exponential population growth
- Alfred Wallace: similar idea to Darwin, but Darwin published first

## Artificial Selection/Selective Breeding

- Humans select for traits that they want
    - Ex: dogs, plants, farming, etc

## Mutation

- Mutation: change in the DNA sequence
    - Can be beneficial, neutral, or harmful
    - Can be passed on to offspring
- Mutations are random
    - Not directed
    - *Tested* by natural selection to see if it is beneficial

## Evidence for evolution

### Biogeography

- Geographic distribution of species – plants and animals are similar in same geographic region
- Pangea breaks apart 200mya
- Continents as of today 20mya
- Similar species occur nearby in space because descended from common ancestor

### Paleontology

- The study of extinct lifeforms and their fossils
- Can find fossil's time period
    - Radioactive dating
    - Location of fossils in rock layers
- Fossils can be persrved if covered by fine dust

### Transitional fossils

- The identification of transitional fossils in particular is considered strong evidence for evolution
- *Tiktaalik*:
    - Lived approximately 375 mya (fossils discovered in 2004 in Canada)
    - Is believed to be the intermediate form between certain fish (380 mya) fish and early tetrapods (365 mya)
    - Transitional fossil between fish and land animals

### Homologous structures

- Similar structures that have different functions
- Same ingredients, different recipe
- **Law of Used Parts**
    - Same bones (STRUCTURE), different uses (FUNCTION)
- Divergence of Structure and Function
    - Present structure/function derived from common ancestor

### Vestigial structures

- Structures that have no current function but are remnants of structures that had a function in an ancestor

### Convergent Evolution

- Not all organisms that appear similar are related by recent descent
- Ex: Sugar glider and flying squirrel
    - Both have similar adaptations to flying
    - But they are not related, no recent common ancestor
        - Sugar glider is a marsupial
        - Flying squirrel is a rodent
- Similar selection pressures can lead to similar adaptations
- Different geographic areas have populations or groups of plants and animals that exhibit similar appearance… even thought distantly related
    - Best example: marsupials and placentals
- ![Convergent Evolution](./Photos/ConvergentEvolution.jpg)

### Embryology

- Embryology: the study of embryos and development
- Embryos of different species look similar in early stages of development
- ![Embryology](./Photos/Embryology.jpg)

### Molecular Record

- Genes, DNA
- Hemoglobin
    - Can be compared to corresponding respiratory transport molecule in other species
    - Closely related organisms will exhibit fewer differences in the structure of this protein
- ![Molecular Record](./Photos/MolecularRecord.jpg)

## Direct examplea

- New fruit introduced into Florida
    - With thinner skin
    - The beak length of the native insect became shorter
    - The selection pressure for longer beaks was removed

## Evolutionary Arms Race

- ![DDT](./Photos/DDT.jpg)
    - The mosquitos that were resistant to DDT survived and reproduced and passed on their genes to their offspring
    - Added DDT as a selection pressure
- Same for bacteria and antibiotics
- Some traits have costs
    - Ex: snake speed vs poison resistance

## Gene Variation

- Microevolution: “Adaptation by Natural Selection” 
	- Evolutionary changes in gene frequency
	- Leads to microevolution within a species
- Macroevolution: ”Accumulation of These Changes”
	- Creation of new species
	- Extinction of old ones

# 2/10

## Evolution of Populations

- Natural selection acts on individuals, and as a result, populations evolve over time
- For populations to evolve (change) over time, individuals in the population must exhibit variability
- Mutation is the ultimate source of new alleles in a population, but meiosis and sex generate variability in population by creating unique combinations of alleles.

## Genetic Structure of a Population

- **SPECIES**
	- A group of individuals who can breed & produce viable, fertile offspring
- **POPULATION**
	- Localized group of individuals of the same sp.
	- May be isolated from other pops. of the same sp.
- **GENE POOL**
	- All the alleles in a pop. at any time
	- Remember for diploids, you have 2 copies of every gene
	- For multiple alleles, each has a relative frequency in the population

## Determining Whether or Not a Population is Evolving: quantifying changes in genetic variability

- A population’s genetic make-up is typically described by measuring allele frequencies in its gene pool
    - If allele frequencies change over time, the population is evolving
- Frequency of an allele: (# of copies of an allele) / (# of copies of all alleles at the locus)
- For a locus with 2 alleles:
    - P = frequency of one allele (usually the dominant allele)
    - Q = frequency of the other allele (usually the recessive allele)
    - P + Q = 1
- ![Allele Frequency](./Photos/AlleleFrequency.png)

### Hardy-Weinberg

- Populations that are NOT evolving are in **Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium**
    - The frequencies of alleles and genotypes in a population will remain constant from generation to generation in the absence of any disturbing forces
- ![Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium](./Photos/HardyWeinbergEquilibrium.png)
- Hardy-Weinberg Equation: p2 (AA) + 2pq (Aa) + q2 (aa) = 1 
- The Hardy-Weinberg equation can also be used to determine the percentage of carriers of recessive disease alleles in a population
    - 2pq = % of carriers
- Conditions for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (the absence of disturbing forces):
    - No mutation – alters gene pool
    - Random mating – no inbreeding
    - No natural selection – every individual can reproduce
    - Extremely large population size – rules out sampling error
    - No gene flow – no genes moving in and out of population

## Causes of Microevolution

1. Genetic Drift	
	- Small population
	- Bottleneck effect
2. Gene Flow
	- Migrating individuals
3. Genetic Mutations
	- Only way to get new alleles
4. Selective Mating
	- May lead to sexual dimorphism
5. Natural Selection
    - Generally adapts a pop to its environment
    - Pressure from the environment on an individual

### Founder effect

- New sub group of population is randomly created
- ![Founder Effect](./Photos/FounderEffect.jpg)

### Bottleneck effect

- Population is reduced to a small number of individuals
- ![Bottleneck Effect](./Photos/BottleneckEffect.png)

## Natural Selection

### Directional Selection

- One extreme of the phenotypic range is favored
- ![Directional Selection](./Photos/DirectionalSelection.jpg)

### Disruptive Selection

- Both extremes of the phenotypic range are favored

### Stabilizing Selection

- The intermediate phenotype is favored

### Sexual Selection

#### Intrasexual selection

- Typically male-male competition
- Ex: fighting between male elephant seals (the loser will not mate, while the winner will mate with a “harem” of 30-100 females)

#### Intersexual selection

- Intersexual selection (mate choice) can lead to sexual dimorphism (marked phenotypic differences between the sexes)
- Some sexually dimorphic traits may actually decrease survival.
- Why should a female prefer a “showier” male (i.e. why would female preference evolve)?
    - One hypothesis:
        - Honest advertisement: male display indicates they are high quality mates (have “good genes” or are better able to provide for their mate/ offspring) 

### Perfection?

- Natural selection cannot fashion perfect organisms
    - Better than before overall, not perfect
    - No perfect end goal
1. Evolution is limited by historical constraints 
    - Law of Used Parts
2. Adaptations are often compromises
    - Newt/garter snake example
3. Not all evolution is adaptive
    - “The early bird isn’t always the best bird, he was just first”
    - Chance events affect gene pool.
4. Selection can only edit existing variations
    - No on-demand alleles

## Hetereozygote Advantage

- Heterozygote advantage: heterozygotes have higher fitness than homozygotes
- Sickle cell anemia
    - Heterozygotes are resistant to malaria, but its not deadly
    - Homozygote positive is deadly, but more resistant to malaria
    - Homozygote negative (normal) is not resistant to malaria, but no harmful effects

# 2/16

- Barriers to reproduction between species
- Modes of speciation: allopatric, sympatric, parapatric
- Hybrid zones
- Genetics of speciation

## Macroevolution

- The origin of new taxonomic groups (new sp., genera, families, kingdoms)
- Speciation
	1. Anagenesis
		- Transformation of a species into another
        - Much less common
	2. Cladogenesis
		- Branching evolution
- ![Speciation](./Photos/Speciation.png)

## What is a species?

- Compare:
    - Morphology
        - How they look
    - Physiology
        - How they work
    - Biochemistry
    - DNA
- > "The biological species concept defines species as **members of populations that actually or potentially interbreed in nature and produce viable offspring**. (But do not produce viable, fertile offspring with members of other groups.)
- Not exactly perfect
    - Lions and tigers can have childern together in captivity

## Formation of new species

- The formation of new species requires Reproductive Isolation
    - Reproductive isolation: biological barriers that impede production of viable, fertile offspring
- Reproductive isolation blocks gene flow between different species
- ISOLATE THE GENE POOL!

## Types of barriers to gene flow

### Prezygotic (block fertilization)

- Function by:
    - Impeding mating
    - Preventing the successful completion of an attempted mating
    - Hindering fertilization if mating is successful
- Habitat isolation
    - Live in different areas
- Temporal isolation
    - Different mating seasons
- Behavioral isolation
    - Different mating rituals
- Mechanical isolation
- Gametic isolation
    - Sperm and egg don’t work together

### Postzygotic (reduce success of hybrid)

- Reduced hybrid viability
    - Hybrid offspring are less likely to survive to reproductive age
- Reduced hybrid fertility
    - Hybrid can not reproduce
- Hybrid breakdown
    - As generations goes, the hybrid becomes less and less viable

## How do blocks to gene flow arise, leading to speciation?

- Allopatric speciation
    - Subpopulations are isolated geographically
    - Gene pools diverge (mutation, natural selection, genetic drift - allele frequencies change)
- Sympatric speciation
    - Less common
    - Gene flow reduced by polyploidy, habitat, differentiation, sexual selection
- Examples of geographic barriers in allopatric speciation
    - Geographic remodeling:
        - Canyons, rivers, mountains, changing water levels, etc
        - Ex: snapping shrimp on either side of the isthmus of Panama
    - Distance alone may be a significant geographic barrier to gene flow
    - Some populations become isolated when descendents are unable to rejoin ancestral population
        - Ex: Flightless cormorants on the Galapagos Islands cannot return to South America to interbreed with flying cormorant populations
- REMEMBER: Genetic variation must exist or arise between separated populations for speciation to occur  

## Adaptive Radiation

- A result of allopatric speciation

### Sympatric speciation 

- Several mechanisms can lead to sympatric speciation (speciation without geographic isolation):
    - Polyploidy (extra set of chromosomes)
        - Errors in meiosis
    - Autopolyploidy – more than 2 chromosome sets all derived from same species
- ![PolyPloidy](./Photos/PolyPloidy.png)
    - Self-pollinate or mate with other tetraploids – reproductive isolation without geographic separation
- Allopolyploidy:
    - Fertile with each other, but cannot mate with either parent
    - More common in plants
- Sexual selection
    - The other species don't mate with them

### Hybrid zone

- ![Hybrid Zone](./Photos/HybridZone.jpg)
- Often says in a very defined band/zone between the two species
- The hybrids might have poszygotic barriers which keeps them from spreading

#### Hybrid zone outcomes

- Reinforcement: strengthen barriers, fewer hybrids
    - Hybrid zone shrinks
    - Can be caused by:
        - Mate preference is much stronger in sympatric vs. allopatric species of flycatcher to reduce the production of unfit hybrids
- Fusion: weakening of barriers
    - Species become one
    - Can be caused by:
        - Pollution may be reducing sexual selection in the cichlids of Lake Victoria
- Stability: continue to produce hybrids
    - Hybrid zone remains stable

### Punctuated equilibrium

- ![Punctuated Equilibrium](./Photos/PunctuatedEquilibrium.png)

### The basis of speciation is changes in genes

- The genetics of speciation must be considered on a case-by-case basis, but some examples have been found in which a single gene mutation is responsible
    - 2 species of monkeyflower have 1 gene that is different

# 2/27

## What We Can and Cannot Learn from Phylogenetic Trees

- Phylogenetic trees show patterns of descent, not phenotypic similarity
- Phylogenetic trees do not indicate when species evolved or how much change occurred in a lineage
- It should not be assumed that a taxon evolved from the taxon next to it

### Phylogenies are inferred from morphological and molecular data

- To infer phylogenies, systematists gather information about morphologies, genes, and biochemistry of living organisms

### Morphological and Molecular Homologies

- Phenotypic and genetic similarities due to shared ancestry are called homologies
- Organisms with similar morphologies or DNA sequences are likely to be more closely related than organisms with different structures or sequences

## Sorting Homology from Analogy

- When constructing a phylogeny, systematists need to distinguish whether a similarity is the result of homology or analogy
- Homology is similarity due to shared ancestry
- Analogy is similarity due to convergent evolution
- Convergent evolution occurs when similar environmental pressures and natural selection produce similar (analogous) adaptations in organisms from different evolutionary lineages
- Bat and bird wings are homologous as forelimbs, but analogous as functional wings
- Analogous structures or molecular sequences that evolved independently are also called homoplasies
- Homology can be distinguished from analogy by comparing fossil evidence and the degree of complexity
- The more complex two similar structures are, the more likely it is that they are homologous

## Molecular Clocks

- A molecular clock uses constant rates of evolution in some genes to estimate the absolute time of evolutionary change
- Molecular clocks are calibrated against branches whose dates are known from the fossil record
Individual genes vary in how clocklike they are

### Problems with Molecular Clocks

- The molecular clock does not run as smoothly as neutral theory predicts
- Irregularities result from natural selection in which some DNA changes are favored over others
- Estimates of evolutionary divergences older than the fossil record have a high degree of uncertainty
- The use of multiple genes may improve estimates

### Applying a Molecular Clock: The Origin of HIV

- Phylogenetic analysis shows that HIV is descended from viruses that infect chimpanzees and other primates
- HIV spread to humans more than once
- Comparison of HIV samples shows that the virus evolved in a very clocklike way
- Application of a molecular clock to one strain of HIV suggests that that strain spread to humans during the 1930s

# 3/1

## Origin of Life KEY Points

- Life arose from nonliving matter in the early earth environment
    - Falls within general laws of the universe…no supernatural event was necessary
- All life descended from these beginnings
- There was no abrupt transition from “nonliving” to “living” and characteristics of life were acquired gradually
- Living organisms, once they evolved, changed the environment thereby changing the original conditions

## Gradual Chemical Evolution Hypothesis

- ![Gradual Chemical Evolution Hypothesis](./Photos/GradualEvolution.png)

## The Early Earth

- The earth formed ~4.6 billion years ago 
- Earliest evidence of life are stromatolites (fossils of early prokaryotic cells)
- 75% of Earth’s history only microscopic/ unicellular organisms 
- Archaea share more similarities to Eukarya than Bacteria
    - Bacteria branch off earlier in history
- ![Early Earth](./Photos/EarlyEarth.png)
- Chloryphyll evolved because the purple light was not used (only the green)
    - They could uses the unused light
    - Oxygen as a byproduct of photosynthesis
- First extintion
    - Oxygen posioning
    - Killed anaerobic organisms
- Endosymbiotic theory
    - Cell kind of engulfed a mitochondria or chloroplast
    - Evidence:
        - Mitochondria and chloroplasts have their own DNA and their own double cell walls
- 90% of Earth’s existence life was aquatic
- Trying to look for life outside of the earth
    - Most of earth's life did not look like it does not

## Bacteria

- Unicellular
- Very small: 1-5 um
- 3 main shapes
    - Spherical (cocci)
    - Rod-shaped (bacilli)
    - Spiral (spirilla)
- Binary Fission for reproduction
    - No mitosis
    - Duplicate DNA then split
    - No nucleus, no organelles
- Move with flagella
    - Analogous structure
- Prokaryote = bateria | eukaryotes
    - Eukaryote = true + nucleus

## Prokaryote DNA

- Circular DNA
- Have ribosomes, DNA, cell membrane, cytoplasm
- Prokaryotes were the only life on earth for ~2 billion years
- Found almost everywhere on earth
- Out number all eukaryotes combined
- Only a small number are pathogenic (harmful to humans)
    - There is no pathogenic Archaea

### Bacteria vs Archea

- Both
    - Unicellular
- Bacteria
    - Cell wall is made of peptidoglycans (target of many antibiotics)
    - Lives everywhere
    - One RNA polymerase
    - NO histones
    - NO introns
- Archaea
    - Cell wall is NOT made of peptidoglycans
    - Mostly Extremophiles (live in extreme environments)
    - Many RNA polymerases
    - DNA has histones
    - DNA has some introns

## Gram Stain to classify bacteria

- Peptidoglycans: a polymer of sugars and amino acids that form the cell wall of bacteria
    - Target of many antibiotics.  
- ![Gram Stain](./Photos/GramStain.tif)
- Gram Negative
    - Dye did not work on the bacteria
    - Has outer membrane
- Gram Positive
    - Dye worked on the bacteria
    - No outer

## Prokaryotes are extraordinarily successful group of organisms 

- The most successful organisms on earth
- Metabolic versatility (organic and inorganic)
- Enormous reproductive potential
    - E coli can divide every 20 minutes
- They can evolve quickly (but why?)
    - Mutate more per offspring + more offspring
- Survive in a huge variety of habitats

## Horizontal gene transfer

- Bacteria can transfer genes/DNA without having to reproduce
- 1 bacteria shares it to another
    - When they split, now 4 bacteria have it instead of 2
- **Transformation**: free floating DNA is incorporated into bacterial genome
- **Configuation**: DNA exchanged by direct cell to cell contact. DNA is then incorporated into the bacterial genome (or is a plasmid)
- **Transduction**: bacteriophage (viral) DNA is incorporated into bacterial genome
    - Bacteriophage is a virus that infects bacteria

## Prokaryotes have diverse metabolism

- Photoautotrophs: photosynthetic (like cyanobacteria)
- Photoheterotrophs: light + organic compounds (not only CO2)
- Chemoautotrophs: use CO2 + inorganic compounds (mostly  extremophiles)
- Chemoheterotrophs: consume organic compounds 
    - Humans

## Many prokaryotes are symbiotic

- Symbiosis “living together”: ecological relationship between organisms of different species in direc contact 
- Bacteria live in communities: biofilms
    - Surface-coasting colony of prokaryotes living in metabolic cooperation
    - Bacteria work together to resist antibotics
- Types of symbiosis
    - Mutualism (+/+): mutually benefits both organisms
    - Commensalism (+/0): one benefits and the other is not affected
    - Parasitism (+/-): one organism benefits and the other is hurt

## Microbiomes - The ultimate bacterial community

        - Gram positive: thick layer
            - Dye can stain directly
        - Gram negative: outer membrane
            - Dye can't stain directly
- Eukarya
    - Nucleus
    - Membrane bound organelles

## Protist: Introduction to Eukaryotes

- Protists represent a “grab bag” of eukaryotic cells
    - Protist = any eukaryote that isn’t not a plantae, aminmalia, or fungi
- Mostly unicellular
    - But can be multicellular
- Most live in moist or aquatic environments
- Categorized into photosynthesizers (algae) or not

### Remember the Endosymbiont Theory?

- Mitochondria and chloroplasts originated as prokaryotic cells engulfed by an ancestral eukaryotic cell &rarr; evolved into a single organism
- Evidence:
    - Membranes: some organelles have double membranes
    - Antibiotics: susceptiblbe to antibiotics
    - Division: reproduce occurs via a fission-like process
    - DNA: have their own DNA (circular)
    - Ribosomes: have their own ribosomes
- Protist have engulfed other cells than mitochondria and chloroplasts

### Protists play key roles in ecological communities

- Photosynthetic protists
    - Very important in aquatic communities
    - Base of the food chain
    - Can have hold fasts which work a bit like roots to anchor the plant
    - Can have blades (like a leaf)
- Protists form wide range of mutualistic (+/+) and parasitic (+/-) relationships that affect their communities

#### Malaria

- Protist
    - No peptidoglycan cell wall to make it easy to target
- Lives in a misquito
    - Misquito spreads it to a human
- Very small, bacteria like
    - Reproduces quickly and exlodes into a blood stream

### Three major groups of Protists

- Animal-like
    - Ingestive “eaters”
    - Protozoans
    - Some are ciliates
- Plant-like (algae)
    - Photosynthetic
    - Chlorophyll and  chloroplasts
    - Ancestors to land plants

## Kingdom Fungi (not plants)

- There was a time where there were fungi as tall as trees
- Multicellular Eukaryotic
    - Mostly unicellular but can be multicellular
- Cell walls made of chitin
- Asexual and sexual reproduction (spores)
- Fungi that you see are mostly haploid
- Extracellular digestion and absorption
- Heterotrophic decomposers
    - Not from the sun
- Mostly made of **hyphae**

### Fungi Structure: chitin cell wall

- Hyphae: microscopic thin strands of cells that make up fungi
- Mycelium: mass of interwoven feeding web of hyphae
    - Can make up a symbiotic relationship with a plant
        - Can bring nutrients to the plant
- Fruiting Body: reproductive structure that makes spores
- ![Fungi](./Photos/Fungi.tif)

### Fungi Life Cycle: asexual or sexual

- Plasmogamy: fusion of the cytoplasm of two parent mycelia
- Heterokaryotic: result of two haploid hyphae (n + n) fusing
- ![Fungi Life Cycle](./Photos/FungiLifeCycle.png)
    - Do asexual reproduction when life is good
        - Least amount of work
    - When times are bad, do sexual reproduction
        - Mixing DNA might have offspring a better chance of surviving

### Generalized life cycle

- Sexual Reproduction
    - Fusion of hyphae cytoplasm
    - Fusion of hyphae nuclei 
    - Release haploid spores
- Asexual Reproduction
    - Haploid hyphae make spores
    - Spores grow

### What are “spores” and where do they come from?

- Spore: tiny one-celled reproductive (haploid) unit capable of giving rise to a new individual 
- Spore producing cells: asci and basidia
    - In asci, spores fully contained with an outer covering
    - In basidia, spores produced externally

### Three major groups of Fungi

- Zygomycetes
    - Mostly asexual
    - Molds 
    - Bread molds
- Ascomycetes
    - Sac Fungi & yeast
    - Spores made in “asci” 
- Basidiomycetes
    - Club Fungi
    - Mushrooms 
    - Spores made in “basidia”

#### Honey Mushroom

    - More than 90% of plants
- Parasitic:  fungi with specialized hyphae to feed on living organisms

# 3/3

## Earth- ~470 million years ago

- Know plants existed because of their spores
- Cyanobacteria living on the rocks (we think)
- Earliest plants didn’t have leaves
- Symbiotic relationship with fungi for nutrients

## Adaptations for land colonization

- Xylem: water and nutrients from roots &rarr; leaves
- Phloem: transports food from leaves &rarr; rest of plant 
- Stomata (exchange of CO2 & O2)
- Cuticle (prevents H2O loss)
- Lignin (woody part of plants)
- Reproduction changed to protect embryophytes

## Introduction to land plants

- Multicellular photoautotrophs
- Primarily terrestrial 
- Have tissues, roots, leaves
- Sexual reproduction: simple to highly evolved 
    - Alternation of generations: pattern of reproduction altering between haploid and diploid states
- Differentiate plants based on their:
    - Tissues
        - How do they move nutrients around in their bodies
    - Reproductive strategies
- Within vascular plants is the phloem, the vessel that transports food, and the xylem, which transports water. Nonvascular plants are small, simple plants without a vascular system. They do not have a phloem or xylem.
- Rhizoid: a filamentous outgrowth or root hair on the underside of the thallus in some lower plants, especially mosses and liverworts, serving both to anchor the plant and (in terrestrial forms) to conduct water.

## Alternation of Generations

- Haploid (n) Phase = Gametophyte
    - Spores &rarr; gametophyte
    - Produces gametes (sperm and egg)
    - Gametes fuse &rarr; Zygote (2n)
- Diploid (2n) Phase = Sporophyte
    - Zygote &rarr; embryo (attached to the mother)
    - Undergoes meiosis &rarr; spores (n)
- Spores grow into a multicellular gametophyte through mitosis.
- Some cells of the gametophyte develop into gametes (egg and sperm)
- Egg and sperm fuse (2n) and grow through mitosis into the sporophyte
- Sporophyte produces haploid spores…

### The old way

- Plant is either male or female
    - Haploid, gametophyte is the "stem"
- Have sporophyte (diploid) that produces spores at the stop

## Four Major Land Plant Groups

- Bryophytes: non-vascular
    - No tissues
    - Small
    - Ancient
- Pteropytes (Ferns): vascular, seed-less
- Gymnosperms: woody plants (pines)
- Angiosperms: flowering plants

### Bryophytes

- General Characteristics
    - Earliest evolved land plants 
    - Spores instead of seeds
        - Have egg and sperm and they have to find each other
    - Flagellated sperm &rarr; strong ties to water
    - NO TISSUES
    - Non-vascular tissue (rely on diffusion)
    - Haploid-dominated life cycle (gametophyte)
        - Top diplod part: sporophyte
    - Rhizoids (primitive roots)
- Examples: Hornworts, Liverworts, Mosses
- Needs H2O in order to reproduce
    - Life orginated from water (and these were the first plants)

### Seedless vascular plants

- Pteropytes and Lycophytes
- General Characteristics (ferns)
    - Spores instead of seeds
        - Spores are haploid (sporophyte)
    - Vascular tissue (xylem & phloem)
    - Woody lignin tissue for support (taller)
    - Diploid-dominant (sporophyte) life cycle 
    - Flagellated sperm; less dependent on water
    - Roots
        - Need to take water and nutrients from the ground (can live further away from water than bryophytes)
- Examples: Ferns and their relatives
- Needs H2O in order to reproduce

#### Vascular Tissues

- Xylem: transport water and minerals from roots to other parts of the plant (up)
- Phloem: transports sugars and other nutrients around the plant (up/down)

### Gymnosperms “naked sperm”

- General Characteristics 
    - First seed plants (replaces spores)
    - Evolution of pollen (replaces swimming sperm)
        - Doesn't need water to reproduce
        - "Swims" through the air instead of water
    - Developed vascular tissue
    - Evolved to prevent water loss (diverse habitats)
    - Diploid-dominant (sporophyte) life cycle
        - Seed is fertilized and ready to become a plant
            - Needs a male and a female seed/pinecone/etc
    - Microscopic, reduced gametophyte
- Examples: Conifers, Ginkgos, Cycads

### Angiosperms “covered sperm”

- General Characteristics 
    - Evolved ~125 mya (Cretaceous, as dino phase), possibly earlier
    - Huge diversity in numbers and distribution
        - About 260,000 species, most of all types
    - Only plants to make flowers and fruit
    - Coevolved with animal pollinators
        - Allow baby trees/grasses/etc to be spread further from the parent tree
            - So they don't end up competing with each other
        - Takes out the randomness of the wind
    - Diploid-dominant (sporophyte) life cycle
    - Microscopic, reduced gametophyte
- Examples: Flowering plants, Fruits, Grasses

#### Angiosperm Life Cycle

- Pollen lands on stigma
- Pollen tube grows down through style and carries pollen (sperm) to ovary
- Sperm fertilizes egg in ovule. 
- Ovule develops into a seed that contains the embryo
- Ovary develops into fruit

# 3/7

## Evolution from algae &rarr; land plants

- Development of shoots (increased photosynthesis) and roots (absorb water/minerals)
    - Ferns &rarr; vascular tissue (roots/xylem/phloem)
    - Gymnosperms &rarr; seeds
    - Angiosperms &rarr; flowers and fruits (co-evolution) 
- ![Evolution Of Land Plants](./Photos/EvolutionOfLandPlants.png)

## Angiosperms: Monocots & Dicots

- Cotyledon: embryonic leaf in seed-bearing plants (one or more of which are the first leaves to appear from a germinating seed)
- Monocot: One seed leaf (cotyledon)
- Dicot: 2 seed leaves (cotyledons)
- ![Monocots and Dicots](./Photos/MonocotsAndDicots.png)

## 3 Basic Plant Organs (shoots & roots)

- Stems
    - Transport system
    - Connects leaves
- Leaves
    - Sites of photosynthesis
- Roots
    - Anchor plant in soil
    - Absorbs water, minerals
    - Stores food
- ![Roots And Shoots](./Photos/RootsAndShoots.png)

## Three Basic Plant Tissue Types

- Dermal Tissue
    - Outermost layer
    - Single layer
    - “skin” of plant (cuticle)
        - Changes based on environment
            - Ex: dry/desert - waxy
                - Hold in the water
- Vascular Tissue
    - Transport tissue
        - Circulatory system of the plant
    - Xylem (water up)
    - Phloem (sugar up & down)
- Ground Tissue
    - Metabolism
    - Photosynthesis, storage and support
- ![Plant Tissue](./Photos/PlantTissue.png)

## Introduction to Plant Growth

- Growth: increase in mass by mitosis
- Development: progressive specialization
- Lifetimes:
    - Annual Plants: Complete their life cycle in 1 year
        - Annual plants complete their life cycle from germination (the development of a plant from a seed or spore) to the production of seeds within one year and then dies.
        - Shorter life cycle: more offspring, more mutations/adaptations/evolution, seasonal growth
    - Biennial Plants: Complete their life cycle in 2 years
    - Perennial Plants: Live for many years

## Indeterminate Plant Growth

- Growth that is NOT terminated (unlike determinate growth)
- Due to embryonic-like tissue called meristem tissue:
    - Shoot apical meristem (SAM)
    - Root apical meristem (RAM)
- Determinate growth stops once a genetically pre-determined structure has completely formed
- Meristem is the tissue in most plants containing undifferentiated cells found in zones of the plant where growth can take place

## Primary vs. Secondary Growth

- Primary Growth
    - Increase in length of shoots and roots
    - From apical meristem tissue
    - ![Primary Growth](./Photos/PrimaryGrowth.png)
- Secondary Growth
    - Increase in the thickness of a plant
    - From lateral meristem tissue
    - ![Secondary Growth](./Photos/SecondaryGrowth.png)

## Vascular Tissue: Xylem and Phloem

- Xylem (water/minerals): Water and dissolved minerals up from roots to shoots
- Phloem (food): Sugars from photosynthesis to roots and shoots
- ![Vascular Tissue](./Photos/VascularTissue.png)

## Translocation of water by transpiration

- Bad:
    - Loss of water vapor from leaves (90% through stomata)
    - Large amounts of water vapor are lost by transpiration 
        - 450 liters/day in some trees!
- Good:
    - Driving force of movement of water up xylem to leaves
    - Allows plant to cool itself
- ![Transpiration](./Photos/Transpiration.png)

## Forces of in xylem (TACT)

- **T: Transpiration** (water loss through stomata, depends on temperature, humidity)
- **A: Adhesion** (attraction of water molecules to surfaces)
- **C: Cohesion** (attraction of water molecules to other water molecules)
- **T: Tension** (in water column due to transpirational pull)
- ![TACT](./Photos/TACT.png)

## Water goes does down its water potential gradient

- ![Water Potential](./Photos/WaterPotential.png)

## Stomata and Guard Cells

- Gas exchange
- Water vapor and O2 diffuse out
- CO2 diffuses in
- When guard cells fill with water they open stomata
- Trade off: need CO2 but don’t want to  lose too much water
- CAM and C4 plants: change the use of CO2 either temporally (open stomata only at night) or spatially (do part of metabolism in the cells near the veins rather than in the leaves)

## Water movement at the cellular level

- Water moves down its concentration (water potential) gradient into the central vacuole providing turgidity
- ![Vacuole](./Photos/Vacuole.png)
- ![Tonic](./Photos/Tonic2.png)
- ![Cell Water Potential](./Photos/CellWaterPotential.png)

    - Skin, brain, nervous tissue
- Endoderm - inner layer of folded blastula
    - Lining of the gut and other internal organs
- ![Blastula](./Photos/Blastula.png)
- Diloplastic - 2 layers

## The Endocrine System

- Endocrine system: glands that secrete hormones
    - Endocrine glands: Hormone-secreting organs
- Hormones:
    - Chemical signal secreted & carried by circulatory system to regulate physiology or behavior
    - Regulate long-term responses
- ![Endocrine System](./Photos/EndocrineSystem.png)
- ![Hormone](./Photos/Hormone.png)

## Types of hormonal signaling

- Autocrine Signaling: signal to self 
- Paracrine Signaling: to nearby cells
- Endocrine Signaling: into blood
- Neurocrine Signaling: neurons release neuro-hormones into blood stream
- Only cells with receptors respond
    - Receptor can be inside or outside the cell

## Simple Endocrine Pathway

- Stimulus &rarr; Hormone Release &rarr; Receptor Binding on Target cell &rarr; Response
- Negative Feedback: stimulus decreased
    - Examples: insulin
    - Can turn itself off
- ![EndocrinePathway](./Photos/EndocrinePathway.png)

## Simple Neurocrine Pathway

- Stimulus &rarr; Neuron induces release of neuro-hormone &rarr; Receptor binding on target cell &rarr; Response
- Positive Feedback: stimulus increased
- ![NeurocrinePathway](./Photos/NeurocrinePathway.png)

## Two main types of hormones

- Water-soluble hormones
    - Ex: proteins, peptides (polar molecules), insulin
    - Receptors on plasma membrane &rarr; signal transduction &rarr; cell response
        - Can't go through plasma membrane
- Lipid-soluble hormones
    - Ex: steroids (nonpolar molecules), estrogen
    - Internal receptors &rarr; usually goes to nucleus &rarr; stimulate transcriptional change
        - Can go through plasma membrane
   
## Homeostasis and Feedback Loops

- Maintaining homeostasis
    - Nervous system responds to external environment 
    - Endocrine system communicates messages
- ![Homeostasis](./Photos/Homeostasis.png)

## Hormones in your brain

### Hypothalamus-Pituitary Complex

- "Command center” of endocrine system
- Hypothalamus sends neurocrine signals to the pituitary
- Pituitary Gland
    - At base of hypothalamus
    - Size of lima bean
    - Two regions
        - Anterior Pituitary
        - Posterior Pituitary
    - Regulates the function of other endocrine glands
- Examples: seasons and availability of mate triggers reproductive hormones for breeding
- ![Hypothalamus-Pituitary](./Photos/Hypothalamus-Pituitary.png)

#### Anterior and Posterior Pituitary Gland

- Anterior Pituitary Hormones
    - Growth hormone: regulates growth and metabolism in all cells
    - Adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH): triggers adrenals to release cortisol (stress!)
- Posterior Pituitary Hormones
    - Antidiuretic hormone (ADH): ⬆ water retention and ⬇︎urine
    - Oxytocin: targets contractions in the cells of the uterus and mammary glands
- ![AnteriorAndPosteriorPituitaryGland](./Photos/AnteriorAndPosteriorPituitaryGland.png)

#### Posterior Pituitary Gland Example

- Posterior Pituitary & ADH
    - Water homeostasis
    - Too little water: ⬆ADH = ⬆thirst, ⬇︎urine 
    - Too much water: ⬇︎ADH = ⬇︎thirst, ⬆urine
- When ADH levels drop, the kidneys do not reabsorb as much water thus kidneys produce more urine and you get dehydrated!

### Pineal Gland (pinecone shaped)

- Near center of brain
- In nearly all vertebrates
- Secretes melatonin to modulate sleep patterns in both circadian and seasonal cycles
    - Darkness = ⬆melatonin
    - Light = ⬇melatonin

## Thymus Gland

- Above heart of vertebrates
- Produces thymosin which stimulates T-cell production
- More active when kid

## Thyroid Gland

- In the neck of vertebrates
- Hypothalamus triggers release of thyroid hormone and calcitonin
- Regulate metabolism and calcium homeostasis

## Adrenal Glands

- Response to stress
- “Fight or flight” mechanism stimulated by release of hormones:
    - Epinephrine (adrelaline)
    - Norepinephrine
- Adrenaline = rapid boost of energy, increase glucose released by liver cells and fatty acids from fat cells, faster stronger heartbeat, dilated bronchioles in lungs for faster breathing (more oxygen), takes blood away from skin and toward brain, heart, and muscles
- ![FightOrFlight](./Photos/FightOrFlight.png)
    - Left: Epinephrine & norepinephrine
    - Right: cortisol

## Pancreas

- Islets of Langerhans
    - Alpha cells: secrete glucagon, causes liver to breakdown glycogen and release glucose
    - Beta cells: secrete insulin, causes liver to take up glucose and store it as glycogen 

## Diabetes: Type 1 and Type 2

- Too much glucose in blood:
    - Excrete glucose
    - Excrete too much water
    - Very thirsty
    - High volumes of urine
- ![Diabetes](./Photos/Diabetes.png)
- Type 1 (5% of diabetics): failure to produce insulin
- Type 2 (95% of diabetics): cells do not respond to insulin

# 3/21

## The Immune System

- What is the Immune System?
- Big Overview of Immune System
- Innate Immune System
    - First Line of Defense
    - Inflammatory Response
    - Macrophages
    - Antigen presenting cells
- Adaptive Immune System
    - Initial response
    - Secondary response

## What is the Immune System?

- A complex network of cells, tissues, organs, and the substances they make that helps the body fight infections and other diseases
- Two Parts: Innate and Adaptive

## Cells of the immune system- Who are the players? 

- All cells of the immune system have the same origin: hematopoietic stem cells

## Innate vs. Adaptive Immunity

- Innate Immunity (non-specific)
    - First line of defense 
    - Non-specific immune system
        - Responds to all invaders
    - Physical barriers & inflammation
- Adaptive Immunity (specific)
    - Highly specialized, with special cells and processes
    - Antigen-specific response
    - Only in vertebrates
- ![InnateVsAdaptiveImmunity](./Photos/InnateVsAdaptiveImmunity.png)

## Three Levels of Defense

1. Skin and membranes
2. The inflammatory response (phagocytotic cells) 
3. Acquired (adaptive) immunity – only in vertebrates!
- ![LevelsOfDefense](./Photos/LevelsOfDefense.jpg)

## Innate Immune System

- In this scenario, something has moved pass the first layer of defense (skin/mucous/etc)

### The Inflammatory Response

1. Increased blood flow: 
    - Blood vessels dilate
    - "Hot, red", feeling
        - Increase temperature: try to denature the invader
2. Leaky capillaries:
    - Swelling, pain
3. White blood cells:
    - Clean up crew
        - Remove demaged/dead tissue and pathogens from the area
        - Macrophages
            - Phagocytosis
                - Engulf into vacuoles and digest with lysosomes
            - "Strattle" innate and adaptive immune system
- ![InflammatoryResponse](./Photos/InflammatoryResponse.jpg)

## Antigen Presenting Cells:

- All pathogens have antigens
    - Antigens are like an ID tag for the pathogen
- Messengers between innate and adaptive immune systems 
- Take up antigens &rarr; dreak them up &rarr; display pieces of them

## Adaptive Immune System

### Adaptive Immunity using B and T cells

- Humoral Immunity (B cells)
    - Secretion of antibodies
    - Targets extracellular pathogens
- Cell-mediated Immunity (T cells)
    - Activation of cytotoxic T cells
    - Targets intracellular pathogens (infected cells)
    - Causes apoptosis (cell death)
- ![Adaptive Immunity](./Photos/AdaptiveImmunity.png)

### Cells of the Adaptive Immune System: 

- Two types of lymphocytes (B and T cells)

#### B cells

- Form in **B**one marrow
- Express antibodies on surface
- Bind antigen and secrete antibodies or 🡪 memory B cells
- **Humoral Response**
    - 
- ![BCells](./Photos/Bcells.png)

#### T cells

- Form in bone marrow &rarr; **T**hymus
- Express T cell receptors
- Recognize antigens expressed by antigen-presenting cells
- **Cell-mediated Response**
    - Cell to cell warfare
- ![TCells](./Photos/Tcells.png)

### Antigens and Antibodies

- Antigen
    - Foreign molecule that can illicit an immune response
    - Disease-causing
    - Ex: pollen, bacteria, viruses…
- Antibodies
    - Proteins that bind specifically to antigens
    - Try to inhibit or destroy the antigen
    - Made in B cells
    - Carried in blood plasma
- Self vs. non-self:
    - Immune system needs to be able to identify which particles are foreign and which are part of your body. 
- 4 amino acid chains: 2 heavy, 2 light come together at variable region (antigen-binding domain)
- ![AntigensAntibodies1](./Photos/AntigensAntibodies1.png)
- ![AntigensAntibodies2](./Photos/AntigensAntibodies2.png)

## Humoral vs. Cell-mediated Immunity

- Helper T cells: bind to antigen presenting cells and stimulate both humoral and cell-mediated responses
- Humoral: anti-body mediated &rarr; by macromolecules found in extracellular fluids.
- Cell-mediated: does NOT involve antibodies but rather activation of T cells
- ![HumoralVsCell-MediatedImmunity](./Photos/HumoralVsCell-MediatedImmunity.png)

## Primary vs. Secondary Response

- Initial immune response produces memory B and T cells
- Primary response: first time you encounter an antigen
    - Takes time to make antibodies
    - Takes time to make memory cells
- Secondary response: second time you encounter an antigen
    - Memory cells are already there
    - Antibodies are already there
    - Faster, longer, stronger response response
- ![Primary and Secondary Response](./Photos/PrimaryAndSecondaryResponse.png)

## Bone Marrow: makes blood cells

- ![BoneMarrow](./Photos/BoneMarrow.png)
- Leukemia: overproduction of abnormal white blood cells

## Abnormal Immune Responses

- Cancer: T cells don't activate against cancer cells
- Allergies: hypersensitivity to environmental antigens
- Autoimmune Diseases: multiple sclerosis, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis
    - Cells attack self
- Immunodeficiency Diseases: SCIDS (bubble-boy) with no B/T cells and AIDS (attacks T cells)

# 3/21

## The Nervous System

### Central vs. Peripheral Nervous System

- Central vs. Peripheral Nervous System
    - Central nervous system (CNS)
        - Brain and spinal cord
    - Peripheral nervous system (PNS)
        - All other neurons
- The nervous system is made of two types of cells: glia and neurons

### Classes of neurons

- Sensory (afferent) neurons:
    - PNS sensing &rarr; CNS
- Interneurons:
    - Only in CNS, connect one neuron to another
- Motor neurons (efferent):
    - CNS &rarr; stimulates muscles, organs, glands
    - Somatic nervous system
        - Voluntary control
    - Autonomic nervous system
        - Involuntary control
            - Happens automatically
        - Ex: digestion, heart rate
        - Sympathetic vs parasympathetic
            - Sympathetic: fight or flight
            - Parasympathetic: rest and digest

### Sympathetic vs. Parasympathetic 

- Sympathetic
    - Stimulates body
    - Stress
    - Prepares body for fight or flight response
        - Prepare for action
- Parasympathetic
    - Relaxes body
    - Opposite effects of sympathetic 
- ![SympatheticVsParasympathetic](./Photos/SympatheticVsParasympathetic.png)

### The knee-jerk reflex

- Neuronal circuit 
    1. Sensory neurons send excitatory signal
    2. Interneurons connect neurons in CNS
    3. Motor neurons stimulate muscles
- No brain involvement so super fast
- ![TheKnee-JerkReflex](./Photos/TheKnee-JerkReflex.png)

### The nerve cell (neuron)

- Dendrites: on cell body to receive info
- Synaptic terminals: send info out
- Cell body: Typical eukaryotic cell 
- Axon: transmits info
- Myelin sheath (glia): wrap axons to help neuron fire
- Node of ranvier: gaps in axon without myelin

### Glial cells (neuron support cells)

- Microglia
    - Like macrophages (scavengers to remove dead cells and debris)
- Oligodendrocytes
    - Produce myelin in CNS
- Schwann cells
    - Produce myelin in PNS
- Create blood-brain barrier
    - Protects brain from toxins
- ![Glial](./Photos/Glial.png)

### The nerve synapse

- Neuron to neuron connections (neuron to muscle/glands/organs)
- Most synapses are chemical using proteins called neurotransmitters
- ![Synapse](./Photos/Synapse1.png)
- ![Synapse](./Photos/Synapse2.png)
- Excitatory Neurotransmitters 
    - Cause an action potential in the receiving neuron
- Inhibitory Neurotransmitters 
    - Suppress an action potential (making it harder for a neuron to fire)

### Resting Membrane Potential = -70mV

- Resting potential 
    - Difference in charge across plasma membrane
    - Inside more negative than outside by -70 mV

### Gated Ion Channels

- Voltage-gated ion channels
    - Open if membrane potential changes
- Ligand-gated ion channels
    - Open if chemical binds

### Action Potential

1. Stimulation of neuron
2. Na+ channels open and flow in
3. At the peak, Na+ channels close and K+ channels open and K+ flows out
4. K+ continues to leave
5. K+ channels close and  Na+/K+ pump restores cell

## Ecology

- Ecology: the scientific study of the interactions between organisms and the environment
- How were break up the environment: biosphere > biome > ecosystem > community > population > individual
    - Population: same species, how they interact with each other
    - Community: different species, how different species interact with each other (competition, predation, mutualism, etc.)
    - Ecosystem: community + abiotic factors
        - Abiotic factors: non-living factors
    - Biome: large area with similar climate and organisms (ocean, etc)
    - Biosphere: all ecosystems on earth

## Ecological Research

- Poses challenges for ecologists:
    - Complexity of questions
    - Diversity of subjects
    - Large expanse of space & time
    - Multidisciplinary nature 
- Ecology provides a scientific context for evaluating environmental issues.

## Abiotic Factors that Affect Ecosystems

	- Behavioral, physiological, & morphological ways individuals deal with abiotic factors
- Population Ecology
	- Concentrates mainly on factors that affect population size & composition
- Community Ecology
	- Concentrates on interactions among organisms such as predation, competition, disease & how this affects community structure
- Ecosystems
	- Concentrates on abiotic & biotic factors of a specific habitat; focuses on recycling of chemicals & energy flow

## Cellular Respiration

- OIL RIG: Oxidation is Loss, Reduction is Gain [of electrons]
- C6H12O6 + 6O2 &rarr; 6CO2 + 6H2O + Energy

### Overview

- Sugar in blood stream
    - Insulin: brings glucose into cell
- Glycolysis: takes place in cytoplasm
- Glucose &rarr; 2 pyruvate
- Pyruvate &rarr; Krebs Cycle
    - In mitochondria
    - Creates ATP, CO2
    - Gets energy from electrons
- Electron Transport Chain
    - Inter membrane space
    - Oxidative phosphorylation
        - Losing electrons, adding phosphates to things
        - Get the energy from the electrons to make ATP
        - A) ETC, B) ATP synthase

| | What | Where | Creates |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Glycolysis | Cytoplasm (no O2 required, all cells) | 2 ATP, 2 NADH, 2 pyruvate |
| 1.5 | Pyruvate oxidation | Into mitocondria (if O2) | 2 NADH, 2 CO2 |
| 2 | Krebs Cycle | Mitochondria matrix/inner part (if O2) | 2 ATP, 6 NADH, 2 FADH2, 4 CO2 |
| 3 | Oxidative Phosphorylation | Mitocondria cristae/inner membrane space (if O2) | About 30-34 ATP |
| Overall | if O2 (aerobic) | Cytoplasm &rarr; mitocondria | About 30-38 ATP |
| 2 | Fermentation | Cytoplasm (no O2) | 2 NAD+, [2 lactic acid, 2 ethanol + 2 CO2] |

### Glycolysis

- Insulin brings glucose into cell (cytoplasm)
    - Glucose can't get into the mitocondria
- Intermediary step: G3P
- Overall: 6 carbon glucose &rarr; 2 pyruvate (3 carbons each)
- 2 ATP in, 2 NADH out, 4 ATP out
    - Net: 2 ATP out, 2 NADH out

### Pyruvate Oxidation

- Pyruvate needs to get into the mitocondria
- Only happens if there is oxygen (aerobic respiration)
- Pyruvated gets oxidized (loses electrons to NAD+)
- Pyruvate &rarr; Acetyl CoA (2 carbons)
    - Other carbon goes to CO2
    - Creates an NADH
- Runs twice for each glucose
    - 2x (NADH, CO2) = 2 NADH, 2 CO2

### Krebs Cycle

- Acetyl CoA &rarr; CO2s, NADHs, FADH2s, ATPs
- Carbons of glucose are recycled
- Runs twice for each glucose
- Energy released from bonds
    - Electron carriers (NADH, FADH2) &rarr; ETC

### Oxidative Phosphorylation

- ETC + ATP synthase
- Electron carriers are oxidized
- ADP &rarr; ATP (phosphorylation)
- Electrons from NADH & FADH2 are passed down the ETC
- In:
    - 10 NADH: 2 glycolysis, 2 pyruvate oxidation, 6 Krebs
    - 2 FADH2: 2 Krebs
- Electron Transport Chain
    - Uses electrons from energy carriers (NADH, FADH2) to pump H+ ions into the intermembrane space
    - Creates an electrochemical gradient of H+ ions in between the inner and outer membrane
    - The "used" electrons are eventually passed to oxygen to form water
        - Final electron acceptor (will take electrons in any form)
    - Cat C: move electrons from III to IV
- ATP synthase
    - Chemiosmosis: uses energy from H+ gradient to make ATP
- Out:
    - NADH -> ~2.5/3 ATP
    - FADH2 -> ~1.5/2 ATP
    - 30-34 ATP
        - Most of the ATP is made here

### No O2 (Anaerobic Respiration)

- Glycolysis still happens
- Pyruvate oxidation, Krebs, ETC don't happen
- Stays in cytoplasm
- 2 types: lactic acid fermentation & alcoholic fermentation
    - Different in different organisms
    - Lactic acid: animal cells
        - Makes you sore (ex: when you run)
        - Goes to liver, gets converted back to glucose
    - Alcoholic: yeast/bacteria
        - Pyruvate + NADH &rarr; Acetalhyde (2 carbons) + CO2 + NADH &rarr; Ethanol (2 carbons) + CO2 + NAD+
            - O2 for CO2 comes from the pyruvate (which has Os that are just not mentioned)
- Main purpose: regenerate NAD+ so glycolysis can continue
    - Gycolysis is not great in comparison to with O2, but better than nothing
- 2x (pyruvate, NADH) = 2x ([lactic aic + NAD+] or [ethanol + CO2 + NAD+])

## Photosynthesis

- 6CO2 + 6H2O (+ light) &rarr; C6H12O6 + 6O2

### Overview

- Location: chloroplast
    - Stack of thylakoids: granum
    - Inside of thylakoid: lumen
    - Stroma: finside of chloroplast
    - Green because of chlorophyll
- 2 parts: light reactions & Calvin cycle

### Light Reactions

- In thylakoids
- H2O &rarr; O2
- ATP & NADPH &rarr; Calvin cycle
- Light energy hits chlorophyll &rarr; electrons get excited and bounce around
    - Get electrons from H20
        - H2O &rarr; (1/2)O2 + 2e- + 2H+ (split by PS II)
- PS II (P680) &rarr; ETC II &rarr; PS I (P700) &rarr; ETC I
    - Creates H+ gradient in the lumen
    - H+ goes through ATP synthase to make ATP
- PS I "recharges" the electrons to be used to pump more H+ ions into the lumen
- NADP+ = final electron acceptor
    - 2NADP+ + 2e- &rarr; 2NADPH

### Calvin/Citric Acid Cycle

- In stroma
- CO2 &rarr; C6H12O6 (glucose)
- ADP & NADP+ &rarr; light reactions
- Cycle:
    - Rubisco: 5 carbon molecule
    - CO2 in
    - ATP, NADPH used
    - Bottom of cycle = G3P
        - Either continues in the cycle or get pulled out to make glucose

# 4/17

- Trophic cascade: changing top of food chain changes/propagates to bottom of food chain
    - Ex: wolves reintroduced to Yellowstone
        - Some deer were eaten
        - But deer learned to avoid areas
            - Led to increasing plant growth and diversity

## Population Ecology

- Population Ecology Definition:
    - Concentrates mainly on factors affecting population size & composition
- Ecologists study:
    - Genetic make-up
        - If population is lower, then genetic diversity is lower
    - Reproduction & behaviors
    - Demographics (size, age structure)
    - Density (number per area)
    - Dispersion/distribution 
        - Clumped, random, uniform

## How do populations change size?

- Population Growth:
    - Births
    - Immigrations
- Population Decline:
    - Deaths
    - Emigration

### Calculating Population Growth...

- Birth Rate (BR) or fecundity
    - Number of births/total number of individuals
    - 100/2000 = 0.05
- Death Rate (DR)
    - Number of deaths/total number of individuals
    - 200/2000 = 0.1
- Net Reproduction (r)
    - BR-DR= r
    - 0.05 - 0.1 = -0. 05
- Population Growth
    - G = r N
        - N = number of individuals
    - G = (-0.05)(2000) = -100
- G + N = new population size
    - so . . .  -100 + 2000 = 1900

### Population Growth

- Exponential Growth (J-curve)
- Doubling Time
- Biotic Potential

#### Limits on the Growth of Populations

- Limiting Factors
- Carrying Capacity
- Logistic Growth
    - (S-curve)
- Environment can only support so many individuals
    - Ex: if there are too many deer, then there will be too much vegetation and not enough for the deer to eat
        - So the deer population will decrease
        - Then the vegetation will increase
        - Then the deer population will increase
        - And so on

## Predator-Prey Relationships

- Carrying capacity is also dependent on who is eating who
- Prey increase -> delayed increase in predator population -> delayed decrease in prey population -> delayed decrease in predator population
    - Slightly offset oscillation in graph

## Life History Strategies

- r-selected or opportunistic populations (reproductive selective – density independent)
    - Maximize the rate of increase – occurs in environments in which population densities fluctuate well below carrying capacity
- k-selected or equilibrium populations (density dependent)
    - Maximize population size – operates in pop’s living at a density near carrying capacity
- Percentage of individuals that make it to life span

## Human population growth

- Decreased Growth
    - More people that are older
- Rapid Growth
    - More people that are younger
- Slow Growth
    - Slightly more younger people than older people

## Energy within an Ecosystem

- ![Ecology Energy](./Photos/EcologyEnergy.png)
- Level = trophic level
    - 0th level = sun
    - 1st level = primary producers
    - 2nd level = primary consumers
    - 3rd level = secondary consumers
    - 4th level = tertiary consumers
    - Ex: sun &rarr; plants &rarr; herbivores &rarr; carnivores &rarr; carnivores
- Heat always lost as energy
- More energy at the bottom of the food chain
    - Lower level has to have at least more than the level above it to have enough food
- Energy flows up the food chain
    - 10% of energy is kept at each level
        - 90% is lost at each level
    - ![Ecology Pyramid](./Photos/EcologyPyramid.jpg)
- Biomass Pyramid
    - ![Biomass Pyramid](./Photos/BiomassPyramid.jpg)
    - More biomass at the bottom of the food chain

## Energy Budgets of an Ecosystem

-  Depends on primary production 
    - 99%: Primary production = light energy → chemical energy (photosynthesis)
    - 1%: hydrothermal vents = hydrogen sulfide (inorganic compounds) → chemical energy
    - Light is either reflected or absorbed
- Only ~1% of light is converted into chemical energy
- ~170 billion tons of organic material/yr.
- GPP (gross primary production) vs. NPP (net primary production)
    - NPP = GPP - R (respiration)
    - Gross primary production = total amount of energy that is converted into organic matter (photosynthesis)
    - Respiration = plant uses in cellular respiration
- Primary production = total biomass of autotrophs
- Ecosystems differ in their amounts of primary production

## Efficiency of Energy Transfers

- Production efficiency varies b/n individuals
- Energy lost at each trophic level (90%)
- Trophic efficiency: the percent of production transfer from one trophic levels to the next (average ~10%)
- Production pyramids show loss of energy from a food chain
- Biomass pyramids show ecological consequences of low trophic efficiencies

## Trophic Structure 

- 1st Trophic Level: Primary Producers
- 2nd Trophic Level: Primary Consumers
- 3rd Trophic Level: Secondary Consumers
- 4th Trophic Level: Third Level Consumers
- 5th Trophic Level: Top Carnivores
- Bottom up control vs top down control
    - Bottom up: drought &rarr; less grass &rarr; less deer
    - Top down control: more wolves &rarr; less deer

## Food Chains and Food Webs

- Who eats whom?
- Determined through feeding relationships
- Transfer of energy - ”food chain” (not realistic)
    - Collectively - ”food webs”
- Organisms can have multiple food web roles
- Transfer of energy limits food chains
- ![Food Web](./Photos/FoodWeb.png)

## Aquatic primary producers

- Photic zone (limited light penetration)
    - Deeper &rarr; less light
- Lower primary producers in tropical/polar regions than expected
- Limiting factors play a huge role
    - Pollution or eutrophication
    - Nitrogen & phosphorus levels low in open ocean
    - Iron availability limited in regions (ex: Antarctica)

## Keystone and Dominant Species

- Dominant Species (urchins)
- Keystone Species (sea otters)
    - Without them, the entire ecosystem would collapse
    - Plays a crictial role in maintaining the diversity of the ecosystem
    - Keystone implies one species
        - But many/all species are important
        - Ex: QB is keystone - if you have no QB you can't do anything
    - Ex: no sea otters &rarr; too many urchins &rarr; no kelp
- ![Keystone](./Photos/Keystone.png)
- ![Sea Otter](./Photos/SeaOtter.png)

## Terrestrial Primary Producers

- Limits on P.P.
- Temperature/Weather 
- Moisture
- Availability of nutrients
- “Secondary production”: energy converted by consumers

## Chemical Recycling

- Hydrological Cycle
- Carbon Cycle
- Nitrogen Cycle
- Phosphorus Cycle
- ![Recycling](./Photos/Recycling.png)

### Hydrological Cycle (water cycle)

- ![Hydrological](./Photos/Hydrological.png)

### Carbon Cycle

- ![CarbonCycle](./Photos/CarbonCycle.png)
- Deposing things also release carbon dioxide

### Nitrogen Cycle

- ![NitrogenCycle](./Photos/NitrogenCycle.png)
- 60% of atmosphere is nitrogen
    - Bacteria would "fix" nitrogen into a usable form (into soil)
- Plants need nitrogen

### Phosphorus Cycle

- ![PhosphorusCycle](./Photos/PhosphorusCycle.png)
