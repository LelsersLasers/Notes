- Oxidized to reduced:
	- CO2
		- Can't "squeeze" anmore energy out of it
	- CH4
	- C H3 OH
	- C=0 H2
	- O=C=O
- Tendency to oxidize
	- Reducions: unfavorable
		- But each stuff (starches, etc) in a reduced form

# Glycolysis

- Glucose &rarr; cell
	- Glucose is polar, needs a path
		- Helper protien channels
- *Glucose* first goes to ***cytoplasm***
	- Reducing environment
	- *Glucose* &rarr; *glucose-6-phosphate*
		- 6th carbon gets phosphorliated
		- Phosphorilzation
			- Add phosphate
		- Hexokinase
		- Gives *glucose* a charge
			- Keeps it from un-diffusing
			- Unstablizes it (easier to break down later)
		- **Uses 1 ATP**
	- *Glucose-6-(P)* &rarr; *fructose-6-(P)*
		- Isomers
		- More symmetrical
	- *Fructose-6-(P)* &rarr; *fructose-1,6-(P)*
		- Phosphofructokinase
			- ATP is a allosteric inhibitor
				- If you have a lot of ATP, no need to run the reaction to make more
			- Acid is a allosteric inhibitor
				- Too much latic acid &rarr; stop glycolysis from eventually turning into lactic acid
		- **Uses 1 ATP**
		- Non-reverisble
		- Fructose-1,6-(P) can be used for more than just glycolysis
	- *Fructose-1,6-(P)* &rarr; *glyceraldehyde-3-(P)* and *DHAP*
		- Aldolase
		- *DHAP* is immediately converted to *glyceraldehyde-3-(P)* (so basically 2x *glyceraldehyde-3-(P)*)
	- 2x *Glyceraldehyde-3-(P)* &rarr; 2x *1,3-bisphosphoglycerate*
		- + 1 Pi
			- Inorganic phosphate
		- NAD+ (+ H+) &rarr; NADH (+ H+)
			- **Makes 1 NADH per glyceraldehyde-3-(P)**
				- **2 NADH per glucose**
		- Main point: added another phosphate
	- 2x *1,3-bisphosphoglycerate* &rarr; 2x *3-phosphoglycerate*
		- Move 1 phosphate onto ADP
			- ADP &rarr; ATP
			- Substrate-level phosphorylation
				- Direct simple phosphorylation
	- 2x *3-phosphoglycerate* &rarr; 2x *2-phosphoglycerate*
		- Just moves the phosphate
	- 2x *2-phosphoglycerate* &rarr; 2x *PEP*
	- 2x *PEP* &rarr; 2x *pyruvate*
		- Makes 2 ATP per *PEP*
			- **4 per glucose**
				- **2 net ATP**
				- **2 NADH per glucose**
			- Substrate-level phosphorylation
		- *Pyruvate* can do many things
- Overview
	- 6C &rarr; 6C + (P) &rarr; 6C + 2(P) &rarr; 2x 3C + (P) &rarr; 3x 3C + 2(P)
	- ^ is this right?

## Fermentation

- No oxygen
- Sole purpose: get NAD+
	- Have NADH
- Pyruvate will need to get reduced
	- *Pyruvate* &rarr; *lactic acid*

# Kerbs cycle

- Mitocondria
	- 2 bilayers
	- Intermembrane space
		- Space between the 2 bilayers
	- Matrix
		- Inside the 2 bilayers
- *Pyruvate* &rarr; ***mitocondria matrix***
	- Highly oxididative environment
	- *Pyruvate* &rarr; *Acetly CoA*
		- 3 carbon to 2 carbon
			- 1 carbon is lost &rarr; **CO2 comes out**
				- Most oxidized form of carbon
					- Something had to be reduced
					- **2 NADH** produced
	- *Acetly CoA* &rarr; *Oxaloacetate*
		- **1 NADH** produced
		- Acetly CoA &rarr; CoA
	- *Oxaloacetate* &rarr; *Citrate*
		- TCA = citric acid cycle = Krebs cycle
			- All the same thing
	- *Citrate* &rarr; *Isocitrate*
		- Move 1 OH to another
	- *Isocitrate* &rarr; *alpha-ketoglutarate*
		- 6 carbon to 5 carbon
			- **CO2 comes out**
				- Redox had to happen
					- **1 NADH produced**
	- *alpha-ketoglutarate* &rarr; *succinyl CoA*
		- 5 carbon to 4 carbon
			- **CO2 comes out** - Redox had to happen
				- **1 NADH produced**
	- *Succinyl CoA* &rarr; *succinate* &rarr; *fumarate* &rarr; *malate* &rarr; *oxaloacetate*
		- Cycle must continue
		- This part is big oxidation
			- **NAHD and FADH2 produced**
			- GTP produced (similar to ATP)
- Overview
	- Acetly CoA (2 carbon) &rarr; 2 CO2 come out
	- 1 glucose &rarr; 2 pyruvate &rarr; 2 Acetly CoA &rarr; 2 Kerbs cycle
	- Per glucose:
		- 6 NADH
		- 2 FADH2
		- 2 GTP (ATP)
- **Total output per glucose**:
	- (Thing: glycolysis + kerbs)
	- ATP: 2 + 2 = 4
	- NADH: 4 + 6 + 2 = 10
		- 2 NADH from link reaction
			- *Pyruvate* &rarr; *Acetly CoA*
		- Inbetween glycolysis and Kerbs
	- FADH2: 0 + 2 = 2

# Link reaction

- Happens in the mitochondria matrix
	- Where NADH is made is important
		- Takes effort to move it
		- So, NADH in matrix = more ATP = good

### Inner membrane bilayer

- Complex I, II, III, IV
	- Proteins
- ATP Synthase
1. Complex I
	- NADH (on matrix side) &rarr; NAD+ + H+ + 2e-
	- Electrons bounce "up" to inner membrane space
		- Drags H+ with it into inner membrane space
		- 4H+
2. Complex III
	- Coenyme Q (in bilayer) moves electrons from complex I to complex III
	- Electrons bounce around and drag more H+ into inner membrane space
		- Electrons loose energy and can't use CoQ again
	- 2H+
3. Complex IV
	- Cytochrome C (in bilayer) moves electrons from complex III to complex IV
		- Not a protein
		- On inner membrane space side
	- Electrons bounce around and drag more H+ into inner membrane space
		- 4H+
4. Electrons go to O2
	- Oxygen doesn't care that the electrons are lower energy
		- O2 on matrix side from breathing
	- 1/2 O2 + 2H+ + 2e- &rarr; H2O
- Makes the inner membrane space more positive
	- Dragging H+ into there
	- Acidic (lots of H+)
		- Low pH
- Matrix is negative charge, basic (high pH)
5. ATP synthase
	- H+ can't diffuse back through the layer (polar)
	- Chemiosmosis
		- Wants to move with their gradient
		- Electrochemical reason: H+ is a lot of positive
		- Can use this to make ATP
	- 4H+ + Pi + ADP &rarr; ATP
	- **NADH &rarr; 3 ATP**
		- (Really 2.5, just say 3)
- Complex II
	- Complex II = the enyzme in Kerbs cycle that makes FADH2
		- FADH2 is only in complex II
	- FADH2 &rarr; FAD + H+ + 2e-
		- Electrons get added to the cycle
			- Put on CoQ
	- Complex II does not pump H+
		- **FADH &rarr; 2 ATP**
			- (Really 1.5, just say 2)
