### Homework Questions - 8/18

1. Create a diagram to **describe** the hierarchical organization of the biological world.
```
See 'Levels of order' above.
Atom < molecule < macromolecule < organelles < cells < tissues < organs < organ system < organisms < population < community < ecosystem < biosphere
```
2. **Describe** the characteristics that define life.
```
Order: life is organized and structured (made up of cells)
Response to stimuli: react to surroundings (bend towards light, climb fences)
Reproduction: pass genes to offspring (continue species)
Adaptation: fit to survive/thrive in surroundings, consquence of natural selection
Growth: develop following instructions incoded in genes (ensure that a species's young will be similar to the parents)
Homeostasis: "steady state", adjust/balance to remain internally stable
Energy processing: use a source of energy for metabolic activities
Evolution: diversity is a result of mutations filtered through natural selection
```
3. How do viruses fit into our definitions of living systems?
```
Virsus are not living.
All living things are made of cells, viruses are not.
Virsuses have to invade and hijack to obtain the materials needed for them to reproduce.
```

### Homework Questions - 8/19

1. **Explain** how molecules can be built from atoms by covalent bonds.
```
Covalent bonds share electrons between atoms.
Example: H2O
- The H's would have 1 electron
    - 1 short of filling orbital one
- The O would have 8 electrons
    - Fills orbital one, but needs 2 electrons to fill orbital two
- The H's share their electrons with the O
    - The O now has 8 (6 + 2 * 1) electrons (flling orbital two)
- The O shares 1 electron with each H
    - The H's now have 2 (1 + 1) electrons (flling orbital one)
```
2. **Contrast** polar and nonpolar covalent bonds.
```
Polar:
- Electrons shared unequally
- More attracted to one nucleus over the other
    - Because of unequal distrubation, a partial charge develops
    - Example - H2O: nucleus of O is more electronegative than H
        - Shared electrons will spend more time closer to the O
Nonpolar:
- Electrons shared equally
- No partial charges
- Example - O2: both nuclei have the same electronegativity
```
