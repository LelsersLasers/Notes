## Chapter 1: The study of life

### The process of science

- Inductive reasoning:
  - Particular results to produce general scientific principles
  - "Descriptive/discovery" science
- Deductive reasoning:
  - Logical thinking to predict results by applying scientific principles or practices
  - Hypothesis-based science
- Science:
  - Knowledge that covers general truths or the operation of general laws, especially when acquired and tested by the scientific method
  - Fields of study that attempt to comprehend the nature of the universe
- Scientific method:
  - A method of research with defined steps that include experiments and careful observation
  - Observation -> question (-> hypothesis -> if..then.. prediction)
- Hypothesis:
  - A suggested explanation for an event, which can be tested
  - Falsifiable: able to be disproven by experimental results
- Variable: can change or vary during an experiment
- Control group: every feature that is not manipulated (held constant)
- Theory: a tested and confirmed explanation for observations or phenomena
- Natural Sciences:
  - Fields of science related to the physical world and its phenomena and processes
  - "Hard science" (use quantitative data)
  - Life sciences:
    - Study living things (biology)
  - Physical sciences
    - Study nonliving matter (astronomy, geology, physics, chemistry)
- Basic ("pure") science: knowledge for knowledge's sake
- Applied science: solve real world problems
- Peer-reviewed manuscripts:
  - Scientific papers reviewed by other scientists
  - System of quality control, sharing, and improving/expanding
  - Abstract: concise summary
  - Results section does not contain any interpertion

### Properties of life

- Order
  - Organized and structured
- Response to stimuli
- Reproduction
  - Pass DNA/genes
- Adaptation
  - Consquence of natural selection
- Growth and development
- Regulation/Homeostasis
  - Retain a "steady state"
- Energy Processing
- Evolution
  - Diversity from mutations (random changes over time)

### Levels of order

- Atom:
  - Smallest unit that is an element
  - Nucleus surrounded by electrons
- Molecule: 2 or more atoms held together by chemical bonds
- Macromolecules:
  - Large molecules formed by polymerization
    - Polymer: a large molecule that is made by combining smaller units called monomers, which are simpler than macromolecules
- Organelles:
  - Cells contain combinations of macromolecules surrounded by membranes (???)
  - Small structures within cells
- Cell:
  - Smallest unit of structure and function in living organisms
  - Note: viruses are not alive becaue they are not made of cells
  - Prokaryotes: single-cell or colonial organisms without a membrance-bond neclei
  - Eukaryotes: have membrance-bound organelles and nucleus
- Tissues:
  - groups of similar cells doing similar things
- Organs: collection of tissues
- Organ system: collection of functionally related organs
- Organisms: individual living entities
- Population: all the individuals of a species in an area
- Community: sum of populations in an area
- Ecosystem: all the living things in an area with the abiotic, non-living parts of that environment (ex: nitrogen in the soil or rain water)
- Biosphere: collection of all ecosystems (and represents the zones of life on Earth including land, water, and atmosphere)

### The diversity of life

- Evolution:
  - The source of diversity
  - The process of change from which a new species arises from the older species
- Phylogenetic tree:
  - A diagram showing the evolutionary relationships among biological species
  - Based on similarities and differences in genetic or physical traits or both
  - Nodes and branches

### Homework questions - 8/18

1. Create a diagram to **describe** the hierarchical organization of the biological world.
```
See 'Levels of order' above.
Atom < molecule < macromolecule < organelles < cells < tissues < organs < organ system < organisms < population < community < ecosystem < biosphere
```
2. **Describe** the characteristics that define life.
```
Order: life is organized and structured
Response to stimuli: react to surroundings (bend towards light, climb fences)
Reproduction: pass genes to offspring (continue species)
Adaptation: fit to survive/thrive in surroundings, consquence of natural selection
Growth: develop following instructions incoded in genes (ensure that a species's young will be similar to the parents)
Homeostasis: "steady state", adjust/balance to remain internally stable
Energy processing: use a source of energy for metabolic activities
Evolution: diversity is a result of mutations filtered through natural selection
```
3. How do viruses fit into our definitions of living systems?
```
Virsus are not living.
All living things are made of cells, viruses are not.
Virsuses have to invade and hijack to obtain the materials needed for them to reproduce.
```

## Chapter 2: The chemical foundation of life

### Atoms, isotopes, ions, and molecules: the building blocks

- Atoms:
    - Made up of protons, neutrons, electrons
    - Most stable when outermost (valence) electron shell is filled
    - Electrons can be shared, transferred, or cause charge differences
- Elements:
    - Unique forms of matter that can not be broken down further easily
    - 98 naturally occuring, 118+ total

#### The structure of the atom

- Nucleus
    - Center of atom
    - Contains protons and neutrons
- Protons and neutrons have about the same mass
    - 1 amu (atomic mass unit)
- In neutral atoms, electrons = protons

#### Atomic number and mass

- Atomic number = protons
- Atomic mass
    - Mass number: protons + neutrons
    - Average (mean) of mass number for naturally occuring isotopes

#### Isotopes

- Isotopes: differnt forms of an element that have different number of neutrons
- Neutrons: isotopes
    - C-14:
        - C has 6 protons, so 8 neutrons
- Some isotopes emit neutrons, protons, and/or electrons
    - Radioactive isotopes (radioisotopes)
    - Radioactive decaay: energy loss when an unstable atom's nuclean releases radiation
        - C-14 &rarr; N-14

#### The Periodic table

- Chemical reactivity: the ability to combine and chemically bond

#### Electron shells and the Bohr Model

- Electrons in shells or "orbits"
    - Based on specific energy levels
- Orbitals fill in consistent order
- Octet rule:
    - 2 electrons in the first orbit
    - 8 in the next two orbits
- Valence orbit/shell: outermost orbit/shell
    - Most stable when this is filled
        - Noble/inert gases:
            - Right most column of periodic table

#### Electron Orbitals

- Electrons don't orbit like planets
- Electrons act like particles and waves
- Each orbit/shell has subshells (s, p, d, f)
- See aufbau diagram for order in which subshells fill

#### Chemical reactions and molecules

- 

### Water

### Carbon

2. **Contrast** polar and nonpolar covalent bonds.

# Big Ideas

## Evolution

- The process of evolution drives the diversity and unity of life
- Organisms are linked by lines of descent from common ancestry
- Organisms share many conserved core processes and features that evolved and are widely distributed among organisms today
- Organisms share many conserved core processes and features that evolved and are widely distributed among organisms today
