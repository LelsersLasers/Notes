### Homework Questions - 8/18

1. Create a diagram to **describe** the hierarchical organization of the biological world.
```
See 'Levels of order' above.
Atom < molecule < macromolecule < organelles < cells < tissues < organs < organ system < organisms < population < community < ecosystem < biosphere
```
2. **Describe** the characteristics that define life.
```
Order: life is organized and structured (made up of cells)
Response to stimuli: react to surroundings (bend towards light, climb fences)
Reproduction: pass genes to offspring (continue species)
Adaptation: fit to survive/thrive in surroundings, consquence of natural selection
Growth: develop following instructions incoded in genes (ensure that a species's young will be similar to the parents)
Homeostasis: "steady state", adjust/balance to remain internally stable
Energy processing: use a source of energy for metabolic activities
Evolution: diversity is a result of mutations filtered through natural selection
```
3. How do viruses fit into our definitions of living systems?
```
Virsus are not living.
All living things are made of cells, viruses are not.
Virsuses have to invade and hijack to obtain the materials needed for them to reproduce.
```

### Homework Questions - 8/19

1. **Explain** how molecules can be built from atoms by covalent bonds.
```
Covalent bonds share electrons between atoms.
Example: H2O
- The H's would have 1 electron
    - 1 short of filling orbital one
- The O would have 8 electrons
    - Fills orbital one, but needs 2 electrons to fill orbital two
- The H's share their electrons with the O
    - The O now has 8 (6 + 2 * 1) electrons (flling orbital two)
- The O shares 1 electron with each H
    - The H's now have 2 (1 + 1) electrons (flling orbital one)
```
2. **Contrast** polar and nonpolar covalent bonds.
```
Polar:
- Electrons shared unequally
- More attracted to one nucleus over the other
    - Because of unequal distrubation, a partial charge develops
    - Example - H2O: nucleus of O is more electronegative than H
        - Shared electrons will spend more time closer to the O
Nonpolar:
- Electrons shared equally
- No partial charges
- Example - O2: both nuclei have the same electronegativity

    - Secondary: local folding of polypeptide bonds by hydrogen bonds
        - Leads to alpha helix and beta pleated sheet conformations
    - Tertiary: hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, disulfide linkages, and hydrophobic interactions between R groups, contribute to the folding of the polypeptide
        - Different three-dimensional configurations
        - Most enzymes are tertiary configuration
- If a protein is denatured and loses its three-dimensional shape, it may lose function

    - 9 essential amino acids
    - Same structure, different R groups
        - Determines if it is acidic, basic, polar, nonpolar
- Abbeviated to either 3 letters or 1 uppercase letter
    - Often end in "-ine"
- Sequence ("word") determines the protein's shape/size/function
    - Each amino acid is connected to another by a `peptide` bond
        - Covalent bond formed by dehydration synthesis
    - ![Peptide bond](https://openstax.org/apps/archive/20220801.182716/resources/e3a11ffdd00b8aa60b1e19c6fe12da879a237feb)
    - The resulting chain is called a `polypeptide`
        - `N terminal`: always will have a free amino group ("NH2") at one end
        - `C terminal`: always will have a free carboxyl group ("COOH") at the other end
- Polypeptide vs protein
    - `Polypeptide`: polymer of amino acid
    - `Protein`: polypeptide(s) combined together and sometimes bond to to non-peptide prosthetic groups
        - Porteins are modified during `protein synthesis` (translation)
            - Called `post-translation` modifications
        - Can undergo `clevage` or `phosphorylation`
            - May require addition chemical groups

#### Protein Structure

- An enzymes can bind to a specific substrate at a site
    - Known as an active site
    - If the active site is changed, the enzyme might not be able to bind to the substrate

##### Primary Structure

- Unique sequence ("word") of amino acids in a polypeptide chain
- Can have multiple chains

##### Secondary Structure

- Alpha helix
    - Hydrogen bonds between one amino acid and another than is four further down the chain
    - R groups stick out from the helix
- Beta pleated sheet
    - "Pleats" formed by hydrogen bonds between atoms on the backbone of the polypeptide chain
    - R group extend above/below the folds of the pleat
    - Align parrallel or antiparallel
    - Hydrogen bonds form btween H of amino group and O of carbonyl group

##### Tertiary Structure

- Interactions between R groups
    - Different parts of a polypeptide chain will attract/repel
- Folds/bends ("knots") the chain
- Hydrophobic in the center
- Hydrophilic on the outside
- Interactions between cysteine side chains forms disulfide linkages
    - Only covalent bond forming during protein folding

##### Quaternary Structure

- `Subunits` are formed from multiple polypeptides
- Interactions between subunits form quaternary structure

#### Denaturation and Protein Folding

- Proteins have specific conditions they need
- Changes in temperature, pH, or exposure to chemicals can `denature` a protein
    - Don't like: high temperature and low pH (acid)
- `Denature`: loses its shape
    - If the structure of the polypeptide is retained, it can undenatured (reversed)
    - But is it no always reversible
        - Egg fried
- `Chaperons` (or `chaperonins`) help fold proteins

### Questions

1. alpha vs beta shapes/bonds??

### Homework Questions - 8/30

1. **Describe** the relationship between organic functional groups and macromolecules.
```
Functional groups can be found on the carbon backbone of macromolecules.
They help form monomers that make up the macromolecules.
```
2. What is the relationship between dehydration synthesis and hydrolysis?
```
Dehydration synthesis is building by releasing water.
Dehydration works by taking an H from hydroxyl of one molecule and the entire hydroxyl group of another.

Hydrolysis is breaking by adding water.
It is the reverse of dehydration synthesis,
``` 
3. Relate the structure of polysaccharides to their functions.
```
Polysaccharides are long chains of monosaccharides linked by glycosidic bonds.
- Starch: from amylose and amylopectin (both polymers of glucose)
    - Plants are able to synthesize glucose, the extra is stored as starch
- `Glycogen`: storage form of glucose
    - Made from monomers og glucose
    - Animal equivelent of starch
    - When glocuse levels drop, glycogen is broken down to release glucose (`glycogenolysis`)
- `Celluose`: makes up most of the cell wall of plants
    - Made from glucose linked by β 1-4 glycosidic bonds
    - Rigid and has high tensile strength
```
4. **Describe** the relationship between amino acid sequence and the three-dimensional structure of the tertiary level of protein structure. 
5. **Identify** two environmental conditions that can alter protein structure. 
6. Why do phospholipids form membranes while triglycerides for insoluble droplets?




# Big Ideas

## Big Idea 1

The process of evolution drives the diversity and unity of life.

### Enduring Understanding

- Organisms are linked by lines of descent from common ancestry.
- The origin of living systems is explained by natural processes.

### Essential Knowledge

- Organisms share many conserved core processes and features that evolved and are widely distributed among organisms today.
- There are several hypotheses about the natural origin of life on Earth, each with supporting scientific evidence.

## Big Idea 2

Biological systems utilize free energy and molecular building blocks to grow, to reproduce, and to maintain dynamic homeostasis.

### Enduring Understanding

- Growth, reproduction and maintenance of living systems require free energy and matter.

### Essential Knowledge

- Organisms must exchange matter with the environment to grow, reproduce and maintain organization.

## Big Idea 3

Living systems store, retrieve, transmit and respond to information essential to life processes.

### Enduring Knowledge

- Heritable information provides for continuity of life.

### Essential Knowledge

- DNA, and in some cases RNA, is the primary source of heritable information.

## Big Idea 4

Biological systems interact, and these systems and their interactions possess complex properties.

### Enduring Understanding

- Interactions within biological systems lead to complex properties.

### Essential Knowledge

- The subcomponents of biological molecules and their sequence determine the properties of that molecule.
