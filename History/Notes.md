### Indians of Eastern North America

- Hundreds of tribes between Gulf of Mexico and Canada
    - Lived on squash, corn, beans, and hunted/fished
- Until 5th century, there was no central authority
    - Warred frequently
- Leagues/confederations emerged to unite local areas
    - Southeast: Choctaw, Cherokee, Chicksaw
    - Northeast: 5 Iroquois formed a **Great League of Peace**
        - Mohawk, Oneida, Cayuga, Seneca, Onondaga
- Each group was very different
    - Different politics, religions, languages
    - Identified locally (not countries, etc)

### Native American Religion

- Groups were similair in some ways
    - Focus on relgions, often in relation to hunting/farming
    - Spritual power/spirits infused in everything
        - Wanted the aid of the spirits
    - Religous rites and religious authority structure

### Land and Property

- Village leaders asssigned land to families
    - Families had a right to use the land, but did not own it (not real estate)
- Tribes claimed land for hunting
    - Unclaimed land could be used by anyone
- Sometimes moved often for new/better land
    - Didn't collect wealth/material goods
- Social status mattered, but reputation came from willingness to share goods
    - Trade was more than commerical (generosity was most valued)

    - "Noble savages": gentle, friendly, superior in some ways
    - Uncivilized barbarians
- Negative veiws later overshadowed positive ones
- Barbaric on 3 areas:
    1. Religion - not genuine relgion or the devil
    2. Land use - land was a commodity, not a world of spirits
        - Spanish claimed land by right of conquest and papal authority
        - English/French/Dutch claimed land by saying the natives did not actually "use" the land
    3. Gender relations - weak men and mistreated women

    - Did not live under government or fixed laws
    - Did not use European definitions of authority

    - Freedom to follow spirtual values
    - Well-being and security of the community

### Christian Liberty

- Early European societies were hierarchical
    - Men > women and children
        - "Coverture": when a women married, she lost legal identity to husband
        - King over subjects = husband over family
            - Both "ordained" by God

### Liberty and Liberties

- Liberty came from fullfilling the duties appropriate to one's rank
- Most men lacked the freedom of economic independence
    - Largely controlled and dominated by upper classes
- Remenats of Middle Age "liberties"
    - Formal specific privilages: self-government, no taxes, right to practice a specific trade
    - Granted by contract, royal decree, or purchase
    - No criticism of authority

## Homework Question - 8/22

How can scienctific analysis help us understand history?
Please draw examples from the article and any other examples which come to mind.

Scienctific analysis can help us understand history by uncovering new previously unknown information.
For example, in one part of the article talks about the split between the Andes' lowland and highland people about 8,750 years ago.
Without scienctific analysis we would not have the ability to track the split and the differences of DNA between the highland and lowland people.
This would make it impossible to estimate the the amount of lives lost due to European contact, which is an import part of history.
Scienctific analysis also can help us look much further into the past.
For example it can provide insight on things like the end of the dinosaurs or the formation of universe.

## Homework Questions - 8/24

1. According to this article, what are some of the reasons why Columbus might be considered a hero? A villain?

| Hero | Villain |
| :- | :- |
| - United the people of the world (trade of ideas, goods, etc) | - Brought slavery with him (and disease) |
| - Started the process of the creation of the US (and the good that came from it) | - Partially responsable for the things that came after him |

2. Dr. Fernández-Armesto lists several principles that should control our evaluation of historical people and events.
Which of these is the most interesting, intriguing or significant to you?
Do you disagree with any or would you add any?

I think the idea that contextalization is important is important, especally when looking at good and evil.
It would be unfair to say Columbus was a villain because he believed in slavery.
In the US, 4 of the first 5 presidents owned slaves, but they were still good people that helped many people.

3. What does the author mean when he says for some “moral indignation with Columbus is too precious to discard” and for others “kinship with a culture hero is too profound a part of America’s sense of identity to be easily excised”?
Being transparent about our own biases, which of these categories do you feel you are more likely to fall into?

The author means that people want to believe a partial version of a truth that fits their view of the world.
I think I fall somewhere inbetween.
I would be slightly biased towards "Columbus the villain" because I think it's easier to see the negative consquences than the benefits.
(Killing 1 person carries more weight than saving 1 person.)

4. So was Columbus a hero or a villain? Related to this, should we or should we not commemorate Columbus Day?

Life does not work in black and white.
He should not be be seen as a hero or a villain, but somewhere inbetween.
I think we should not celebrate "Columbus Day" as "Columbus" Day, but something that focuses more about both the new world wide connection and the downsides/consquences. (Celebrated as a day marking the beginning of change.)

## Homework Questions - 8/30

1. According to William Bradford, what was the impetus behind writing the Mayflower Compact?

Some people aboard *The Mayflower* were not completely on the same level of unity as others.
The Mayflower Compact would be an agreement to organize a government that would operate to benefit everyone.

2. What form of government does the Mayflower Compact seek to establish?
Describe this government with reference to specific concepts and terms in the text.

The Mayflower Compact calls the government a "Civil Body Politic".
The government will meet repeatly with the purpse of creating
equal laws, ordiances, acts, constitions, and offices.

3. In what ways might this document be viewed as a “precursor” to the Declaration of
Independence and the Constitution?
In what ways is it different from these documents?

The government is made from multiple people and it will create equal laws.
A main complaint leading to the Declaration of Independence was unequal taxing
(and without input from the people).
It is different in the way that the people "promise all due submission and obedience".

### Harvard Alma Mater Song

1. Should Harvard change the lyrics to its Alma Mater Song?

Yes.
I think that it should be updated to match the current ideas of inclusion.
It is different than changing the words of a textbook or document.
It is not hiding the past.
The song serves a different purpose, it is supposed to be a welcoming song,
not a historical document.

2. Why is it important whether or not Harvard made the change?

It does sort of change history.
All the new students will hear the new version and have a different idea of what Harvard
is compared to those before.
It further detaches Harvard from its past.

3. How does this discussion relate to other questions of historical legacy and memory in America?

People will forget about this change, and the updated song will sort of overwrite the original in history.

## Origins of American Slavery

- Need for workers
    - Indentured servants weren't cutting it &rarr; slave trade

    - Knew what they were doing
    - Already exposed to European diseases
    - Slavers forever
        - Children would be slaves
    - Did not have basic Englishman's rights
    - Hard time escaping
        - Visually different
        - Did not know the land

### Englishmen and Africans

- English did not like foreigners
    - Africans, Irish, Native Americans
    - Savage
- Race/Racism not fully devolped at this time
    - But similar ideas of "us" and "them" were present

### Slavery in History

- Was always a thing
    - Prisoners of war, etc
- In Americas, slavery was based around the plantation
    - Economic/agricultural enterprise
    - Hard demanding labor
    - High death rates
    - Became associated with race/skin color

### Slavery in the West Indies

    - Expensive compared to indentured servants (they often died before they could get their worth)

### Slavery and the Law

- Spain's laws were transfered to its American colonies
    - Often ignored, but slaves had some rights
- English laws became much worse
    - In some places, there wasn't a clear line between black and slave
        - However, it was far from equal

### The Rise of Chesapeake Slavery

- Officals wanted to improve status of all white people to make it more appealing to migrate there
    - As a result, it got worse for blacks
        - You were either white or other (no inbetween)
- 1662: Virginia law where child takes mother's status
    - Better for abusing slaves so the kids would also be slaves

## Homework Questions - 8/31

1. What is the Flushing Remonstrance?
Who drafted it, why, and what is its basic message?

Settlers drafted it in 1657 in Flushing.
They wanted to petition the Dutch colonial government uphold freedom of conscience and permit religious pluralism.

2. Why do you think Governor Stuyvesant rejected the Remonstrance?
Are there any understandable or justifiable reasons for him to deny religious or ideological diversity in this new colony?

He rejected it because he would only tolerate his Dutch Reformed Church (and the Remonstrance went against that idea).

3. What has been the legacy of the Remonstrance?

It was the first document in America to argue for religious freedom.
Also the people did not just argue/petition to solve their own problems, they argued for everyone's right to choose.
It lead to Queens being one of the most divese country in the US.
However, there is no proof that later advocators for rights
(like those who wrote the Bill of Rights, Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, or the Declaration of Independence)
were influenced by the Remonstrance.

## Class Notes - 9/2

- Constellation of features
    - Group a set of features (skin color, hair, facial structure) into a racial category
- Police boundries
    - Not nessissarly based on ancestry
        - More based on visual features

    - Man made (doesn't make it false)
    - We give value to the assumed "race"
    - Paper money based on the fact that other people think it has value/meaning
- **Essentialization**
    - Ascribing one trait to another trait
    - Renforces/strengthens social construct
        - Leads to stereotypes
    - She is good at math because she is Asian

### Power of an Illusion: Race

- "All men are created equal"
    - Had slaves
- How people assign meaning to how they look
- Notes on the State of Virginia (Thomas Jefferson)
    - Africans might be different from time/circumstance but they are inferior
- Not all are "men"
    - Justified slavery
- In early America: economic status and religion > race/skin color
    - Slow shift
- Replaced indured servants with African slave trades
    - Europeans weren't willing to come to America anymore
    - Became: "black (slaves)" and "white European (masters)"
        - Became more accepted/"natural"

### Inventing Black and White

- Fearful of African + indentured servant force
- Gave lowest "whites" more rights to distinguise them from the African slaves
    - Less likely they would unite again

1. Why was Bacon's Rebellion a turning point for the status and rights of people of African descent in Virginia?
    - Associated them with perpetral slavery
    - Worse rights
    - Now more sperated from the "whites" 
2. What motivated Virginia's lawmakers to make legal distinctions between white and black inhabitants?
What effect did those distinctions have on Virginia's universe of obligation?

    - They were worried about another combined force of Africans and indentured servants (Europeans)
    - Sought to make them seperate so they could not join again
    - Not obligated towards the slaves
    - Yes, they do influence the way people think about who belongs because they are the formal written guide
        - Carries different weight
3. What does Ira Berlin mean hwne he says that freedom and slavery were created at the same moment?
How does creating an "out" group strengthen the identity and status of the "in" group?
    - Your identity is "not the out group" &rarr; desire to be in the in group
4. Not going to type question
    - Rich people could get richer
    - Easy to say:
        - Relative to me, Africans are all slaves, so Africans are meant to slaves
    - The poor whites could now say:
        - I am different that the slaves
        - Part of the group that has rich people

## Homework Questions - 9/3

1. What makes 1619 such a momentous year both for Jamestown and for American history?

In 1619, the first Africans arrived in Virginia.
They came as unwilling slaves who were stolen from their homes.
It marked the start of imported slavery that still has impact today.
Also in that year, the General Assembly (the House of Burgesses)
met for the first time, marking the beginnings of representative
government in the colonies.
(And the first women arrived in Jamestown in 1619.)

2. What, according to this article, makes American slavery unique from its global counterparts?

Slavery was permanent and hereditary.
Childern inherited their parents status so they were enslaved at birth.

3. Knowing what you know now about the history of slavery in America – from the
horrendous cruelty of slavery itself to the horrors of the Civil War to the continued civil
rights abuses and racism it spawned even after its abolition – what would you have done as
a member of Jamestown to try to avert this history from coming to fruition?

I think it would have been hard to change things.
Looking back on it, we now know much more than the people at the time.
Also, the people at that time were looking for profits and did not care about the well being of "other" (as in not their people) people.
I think the best chance for changing the course of history would be
to educate people before the imported slaves arrive that those people are still people.

### The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano, or Gustavus Vassa, The African

1. At the end of the first sentence, the author writes that the slave ship was “waiting for its cargo.”
To what cargo is he referring?

The slaves

2. Describe the conditions on board the boat, specifically those under deck.

Terrible.
Terrible smell, very compact, hot, unsanitary.

3. Why did the narrator get beaten for not eating?

So he would survive (and the owners would not lose money).

## Homework Questions - 9/6

1. What about Benjamin Franklin’s life do you find most interesting or intriguing?

I found the fact that Benjamin created a fire department interesting.
I would not have thought that it was something that was important/needed,
but it was mentioned multiple times in the article.
I think it woul be intresting to learn more about when/how/why he created it.

2. Is there anything about his life that surprised you, perhaps even scandalized you?

I did not know he had a large family.
It surprised me that his family was not super "close".
For example when his brother would not publish his writings
and got mad when he found out how Benjamin had tricked him,
Benjamin left and moved to Philadelphia.

3. Of his many achievements, which do you consider Benjamin Franklin’s greatest and why?

I think his greatest achievement was his particpation in the creation of the Declaration of Independence.
I think it his greatest achievement because it was a very important moment for the

        - British tax that the colonists felt that voilated their liberty
    - Hutchinson had defended Andrew Oliver (a relative) who was helping to administor the Stamp Act
    - Led by Ebenezer Mackintosh

## The Crisis Begins

### Consolidating the Empire

- 1760: King George III takes British crown
- Saw the colonies as just a way to enrich Britain
    - Contrast from the notion of "allies" during the Seven Years' War
    - Needed a way to pay for the war
- **Virtual representation**
    - Every member represented the country as a whole, not just the area they were from
    - The colonies and even major British cities (Manchester and Birmingham) were not represented
- **Writs of assistance**
    - General search warrants to search anywhere
    - To combat smuggling (and enforce Navigation Acts)
- Also not happy with the Proclamation of 1763

### Taxing the Colonies

- 1764: Sugar Act
    - Reduced tax on molasses
    - However, further shutdown smuggling
        - Courts often sided with the smuggler &rarr; they could be judged without a trial
    - Trying to enforce Navigation Acts
        - Now colonies were taxed directly instead of indirectly on the trade
        - Affected the colonial ports the most
- Currency Act
    - Confirmed the ban of using paper as "legal tender"
        - Coins or banknotes that must be accepted if offered in payment of a debt
- Stamp Act
    - Affected everyone
    - Led to British army stationed in America to enforce
    - Displeased many of the writers and those who controlled the press
    - Displeased the local elites who lost power as a result of this
    - "Property was taken away without consent"
        - Colonists wanted the rights of an Englishman

### Taxation and Representation

- Bristish saw colonies as outposts of an empire
    - They chose the represetives in America
- The colonists saw themselves as equals to those on the mainland
- Because they were unrepresented in Parliament, they could not be taxed by it
    - "No taxation without representation"
- House of Burgesses (Virginia) under Patrick Henry passed laws arguing for "British freedom"
    - Colonists should get same rights/liberties as British citizens because they were British citizens
- 1765: **Stamp Act Congress**
    - 27 delegates from 9 colonies
    - Still loyal and obedient to the crown
    - However, right to constent of taxation was essential to the freedom of a people
    - Resulted in boycotting all British goods
        - First time the colonies worked together

### Liberty and Resistance

- "Liberty" began becoming a common topic and took many forms of visual representation
- **Committe of Correspondence**
    - In Boston
    - Before Stamp Act was passed, spread word and encourged opposition to it (and the Currency Act)
- Resistance to the acts were often started by elites, but they spread to everyone
- 1765: **Sons of Liberty**
    - NYC residents led protests and enforced boycotting of British imports
- 1766: Britain repealed the Stamp Act
    - Did not expect American resistance to it
    - Also pressured by British merchants who were losing money
        - (Couldn't sell stuff to America with the boycotts)
- However, at the same time, Britain passed the **Declaratory Act**
    - Parliament had the right to tax the colonies in any case

### The Regulators

- As colonies expanded westward, there were more conflicts
    - Land disputes between settlers, colonial governments, and Indians
    - Liberty in relation to secure possession of land
        - Compared to liberty in relation to Stamp Tax was about taxes
- **Regulators**
    - Mid-1760s
    - Wealthy residents from the South Carolina backcountry
    - Protested the under representation of western settlements
    - As well as the failure to create local governments
- At the same time, in North Carolina some small farmers rebelled
    - Kidnapped local officals and refused to pay taxes
    - Caused general disruption
- Wanted democratization of local government
    - Went against the rich and powerful (the colony's elite)
- 1771: "battle of Alamance"
    - The farmers were suppressed by the colonial militia

## The Road to Revolution

### The Townshend Crisis

- 1767: **Townshend Acts**
    - Taxed glass, lead, paint, paper, and tea
    - During the Stamp Act, some colonists had said they would be okay on taxing trade
        - Just not taxing them directly
    - Also created a board to collect the taxes and further stop smuggling
- Opposition to it came slower than the Stamp Act
    - But by 1768, some colonies reinstanted the boycotts
- Led to increased independence from Britain
    - Began producing goods within America
        - Became a symbol of resistance
        - Daughters of Liberty: homespun clothes
    - Popular especially in the Chesapeake so the planters did not have to pay as much money to British merchants
    - Also reduced competition with British merchants

### The Boston Massacre

    - One of the people killed in the Boston Massacre
- John Adams successfully defended 7 of the soldiers
    - Viewed lower class crowd rioting as a bad way of opposing British policies
- However, Paul Revere made a famous engraving of the event
    - Helped stir up more anger against the British
- But by 1770, merchants and colonial elites were not doing well without British goods
    - Eventually Townshend Acts were repealed and the boycotts ended
    - Tea tax remained

### The Tea Act

- The East India Company stock collapsed
    - It had a large monopoly over trade
    - Effectively ran British India
    - Many many people had invested in it
- To help the company (and thus its supporters), the British government tried to promote it in America
    - It was given rebates and tax exemptions
        - Underpriced local tea and smugglers in America
- Colonists saw this as an extention of the Declatory Act
    - It would acknowledge the right of Britain to tax the colonies
- 1773: **Boston Tea Party**
    - Threw 300 chests of tea off a ship and into the water
    - Cost them 10,000 (about 4 million today)

    - Small towns or other places that did not participate in previous resistance
- 1774: Suffolk Resolves
    - Resolved to resist the Intolerable Acts
    - Refuse to obey or pay taxes and to prepare for war
- 1774: **Continental Congress**
    - 12 colonies (except Georgia)
    - Purpose: to coordinate resistance to British policies (especially the Intolerable Acts)

### The Continental Association

- The Continental Congress promoted the Suffolk Resolves
- And adopted the Continental Association
    - Halt trade with Britain (and the West Indies)
    - Created local Committees of Safety
        - Implement the mandates and punish "enemies of American liberty"
        - Transfered effective political power from the colonial governments (controlled by Britain)

### The Sweets of Liberty

- By 1775 the idea of "liberty" was very popular
- Based ideas on both the rights of an Englishman and natural rights and univeral freedom
    - John Locke's theory of natural rights

    - But took heavy casualties
- March 1776: British lose control of Boston
    - Colonists aided by those extra cannons

### Independence?

- Many still supported Britain
    - Feared cutting ties with Britain would lead to further chaos
- Elites in Massachusetts and Virginia supported the break with Britain
    - Confident in their ability to retain control
- Novemeber 1775: **Lord Dunmore's Proclamation**
    - Offered freedom to slaves who fought for the British
    - Further enraged the South against Britain
- Because of high diversity in New York and Pennsylvania, they were more hesitant to break with Britain
    - Wanted peace with Britain
    - Feared internal conflict after break with Britain (sort of predicted Civil War)

### *Common Sense*

- January 1776: ***Common sense*** by Thomas Paine
    - Criticized the British government
    - Argued for independence
    - Did not just repeat grievences of the colonists
        - Reached a new audience, spread it to all the people, not just the elites

## Homework - 9/17: Moment of Decision! 1776

### 1) An introduction of your character: Rebecca Howe

I am a 48 year old single mother who is the owner of this inn.
Creating this buisness was hard, and has only been harder since he died 5 years ago.
Because of this, I am thankful for any visitors I get regardless of who they are or what they believe.
My rum is made from completely legal molasses and my son is definitely not a member of the rebel militia.

You are the forty-eight-year-old owner of a public inn at which this evening’s discussion is
taking place. You and your husband worked hard to build up your business. Since his death five years ago, the
burdens on you have grown heavier. The local British magistrate is a frequent visitor to your inn, and you are
grateful for the business he brings. Of course, you do not tell him that the rum you serve is made from smuggled
molasses. You also do not dare admit that your son is a member of the rebel militia in your county. You are very
worried that he may go off to war.

### 2) An explanation of your top option: 2

My top option is option 2.
My son "is a member of the rebel militia" and I am "very worried that he may go off to war" (and die), 
so I do not agree with options 3 or 4 which want us (my son) to fight.
I agree more with option 2 than than option 1 because I agree some things do need to change,
otherwise I would not even be hosting this discussion.
For example, the rum I make "is made from smuggled molasses" which I would not have to do if things were different.
However, I don't have anything particularly against the British,
and the "local British magistrate is a frequent visitor to" my inn
which provides good buisness.

While I am leaning toward Option 2, I could be persuaded to Option 1.

### 3) Generate at least one question for each of the other options

| Option | Question |
| :- | :- |
| 1 | Shortly after the Stamp Acts were repealed, we were hit by the Townshend Acts which had many of the same problems as the Stamp Acts and had the same outcome. Don't you think it's time for change now rather than just be used to help Britain? |
| 3 | While Britain could have treated us better, do you really think that it is best to risk our lives for something that could be solved with discussion? We did end up getting the Stamp Acts and Townshend Acts repealed. |
| 4 | Is it really best to leave Britain? We owe our entire existance on these lands to them. |

### 4) Look over and take notes on the bios of the other characters

### Other notes

#### Option 1

Beliefs and Assumptions Underlying Option 1:
1. No society on earth enjoys greater liberty and prosperity than the American colonies. Much of our good fortune, especially with respect to trade, is due to our status within the British Empire.
2. Accepting the authority o Parliament is a reasonable price to pay for Britain’s protection of the colonies
3. We are called upon by God to respect the legitimate authority of government.

Supporting Argument for Option 1:
1. The colonies will be crushed militarily and ruined economically by a full-scale war of rebellion
2. Breaking our ties with Britain will embolden the lower classes to challenge the authority of their betters
3. Without the unifying force of British rule and the protection of the British navy, the colonies will squabble among themselves and present an inviting target for aggressive foreign powers

#### Option 2

Beliefs and Assumptions Underlying Option 2:
1. The legitimacy of Britain’s authority over the colonies is grounded in the mother country’s discover, settlement and continuous protection of America.
2. The colonies should be required to contribute their fair share to defend the British Empire in North America.
3. Under the British constitutional system, the citizens of the colonies should have a voice in making the laws
that govern them, especially in the area of taxation.

Supporting Arguments for Option 2:
1. Establishing a joint British-American council—on equal footing with Parliament—to govern the colonies will protect both the rights of the colonists and the legitimate authority of Britain.
2. Resistance to British rule will bring economic disaster to the colonies.
3. Without British authority over them, the individual colonies will turn against each other and plunge into civil war.
