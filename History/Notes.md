### Indians of Eastern North America

- Hundreds of tribes between Gulf of Mexico and Canada
    - Lived on squash, corn, beans, and hunted/fished
- Until 5th century, there was no central authority
    - Warred frequently
- Leagues/confederations emerged to unite local areas
    - Southeast: Choctaw, Cherokee, Chicksaw
    - Northeast: 5 Iroquois formed a **Great League of Peace**
        - Mohawk, Oneida, Cayuga, Seneca, Onondaga
- Each group was very different
    - Different politics, religions, languages
    - Identified locally (not countries, etc)

### Native American Religion

- Groups were similair in some ways
    - Focus on relgions, often in relation to hunting/farming
    - Spritual power/spirits infused in everything
        - Wanted the aid of the spirits
    - Religous rites and religious authority structure

### Land and Property

- Village leaders asssigned land to families
    - Families had a right to use the land, but did not own it (not real estate)
- Tribes claimed land for hunting
    - Unclaimed land could be used by anyone
- Sometimes moved often for new/better land
    - Didn't collect wealth/material goods
- Social status mattered, but reputation came from willingness to share goods
    - Trade was more than commerical (generosity was most valued)

    - "Noble savages": gentle, friendly, superior in some ways
    - Uncivilized barbarians
- Negative veiws later overshadowed positive ones
- Barbaric on 3 areas:
    1. Religion - not genuine relgion or the devil
    2. Land use - land was a commodity, not a world of spirits
        - Spanish claimed land by right of conquest and papal authority
        - English/French/Dutch claimed land by saying the natives did not actually "use" the land
    3. Gender relations - weak men and mistreated women

    - Did not live under government or fixed laws
    - Did not use European definitions of authority

    - Freedom to follow spirtual values
    - Well-being and security of the community

### Christian Liberty

- Freedom from sin: abandon a life of sin ("Christian Liberty")

- Early European societies were hierarchical
    - Men > women and children
        - "Coverture": when a women married, she lost legal identity to husband
        - King over subjects = husband over family
            - Both "ordained" by God

### Liberty and Liberties

- Liberty came from fullfilling the duties appropriate to one's rank
- Most men lacked the freedom of economic independence
    - Largely controlled and dominated by upper classes
- Remenats of Middle Age "liberties"
    - Formal specific privilages: self-government, no taxes, right to practice a specific trade
    - Granted by contract, royal decree, or purchase
    - No criticism of authority

## Homework Question - 8/22

How can scienctific analysis help us understand history?
Please draw examples from the article and any other examples which come to mind.

Scienctific analysis can help us understand history by uncovering new previously unknown information.
For example, in one part of the article talks about the split between the Andes' lowland and highland people about 8,750 years ago.
Without scienctific analysis we would not have the ability to track the split and the differences of DNA between the highland and lowland people.
This would make it impossible to estimate the the amount of lives lost due to European contact, which is an import part of history.
Scienctific analysis also can help us look much further into the past.
For example it can provide insight on things like the end of the dinosaurs or the formation of universe.

## Homework Questions - 8/24

1. According to this article, what are some of the reasons why Columbus might be considered a hero? A villain?

| Hero | Villain |
| :- | :- |
| - United the people of the world (trade of ideas, goods, etc) | - Brought slavery with him (and disease) |
| - Started the process of the creation of the US (and the good that came from it) | - Partially responsable for the things that came after him |

2. Dr. Fernández-Armesto lists several principles that should control our evaluation of historical people and events.
Which of these is the most interesting, intriguing or significant to you?
Do you disagree with any or would you add any?

I think the idea that contextalization is important is important, especally when looking at good and evil.
It would be unfair to say Columbus was a villain because he believed in slavery.
In the US, 4 of the first 5 presidents owned slaves, but they were still good people that helped many people.

3. What does the author mean when he says for some “moral indignation with Columbus is too precious to discard” and for others “kinship with a culture hero is too profound a part of America’s sense of identity to be easily excised”?
Being transparent about our own biases, which of these categories do you feel you are more likely to fall into?

The author means that people want to believe a partial version of a truth that fits their view of the world.
I think I fall somewhere inbetween.
I would be slightly biased towards "Columbus the villain" because I think it's easier to see the negative consquences than the benefits.
(Killing 1 person carries more weight than saving 1 person.)

4. So was Columbus a hero or a villain? Related to this, should we or should we not commemorate Columbus Day?

Life does not work in black and white.
He should not be be seen as a hero or a villain, but somewhere inbetween.
I think we should not celebrate "Columbus Day" as "Columbus" Day, but something that focuses more about both the new world wide connection and the downsides/consquences. (Celebrated as a day marking the beginning of change.)

## Homework Questions - 8/30

1. According to William Bradford, what was the impetus behind writing the Mayflower Compact?

Some people aboard *The Mayflower* were not completely on the same level of unity as others.
The Mayflower Compact would be an agreement to organize a government that would operate to benefit everyone.

2. What form of government does the Mayflower Compact seek to establish?
Describe this government with reference to specific concepts and terms in the text.

The Mayflower Compact calls the government a "Civil Body Politic".
The government will meet repeatly with the purpse of creating
equal laws, ordiances, acts, constitions, and offices.

3. In what ways might this document be viewed as a “precursor” to the Declaration of
Independence and the Constitution?
In what ways is it different from these documents?

The government is made from multiple people and it will create equal laws.
A main complaint leading to the Declaration of Independence was unequal taxing
(and without input from the people).
It is different in the way that the people "promise all due submission and obedience".

### Harvard Alma Mater Song

1. Should Harvard change the lyrics to its Alma Mater Song?

Yes.
I think that it should be updated to match the current ideas of inclusion.
It is different than changing the words of a textbook or document.
It is not hiding the past.
The song serves a different purpose, it is supposed to be a welcoming song,
not a historical document.

2. Why is it important whether or not Harvard made the change?

It does sort of change history.
All the new students will hear the new version and have a different idea of what Harvard
is compared to those before.
It further detaches Harvard from its past.

3. How does this discussion relate to other questions of historical legacy and memory in America?

People will forget about this change, and the updated song will sort of overwrite the original in history.

## Origins of American Slavery

- Need for workers
    - Indentured servants weren't cutting it &rarr; slave trade

    - Knew what they were doing
    - Already exposed to European diseases
    - Slavers forever
        - Children would be slaves
    - Did not have basic Englishman's rights
    - Hard time escaping
        - Visually different
        - Did not know the land

### Englishmen and Africans

- English did not like foreigners
    - Africans, Irish, Native Americans
    - Savage
- Race/Racism not fully devolped at this time
    - But similar ideas of "us" and "them" were present

### Slavery in History

- Was always a thing
    - Prisoners of war, etc
- In Americas, slavery was based around the plantation
    - Economic/agricultural enterprise
    - Hard demanding labor
    - High death rates
    - Became associated with race/skin color

### Slavery in the West Indies

    - Based around a mass marked crop (sugar, rice, tobaco, etc)
- Not as popular in North America at the start
    - Expensive compared to indentured servants (they often died before they could get their worth)

### Slavery and the Law

- Spain's laws were transfered to its American colonies
    - Often ignored, but slaves had some rights
- English laws became much worse
    - In some places, there wasn't a clear line between black and slave
        - However, it was far from equal

### The Rise of Chesapeake Slavery

- Officals wanted to improve status of all white people to make it more appealing to migrate there
    - As a result, it got worse for blacks
        - You were either white or other (no inbetween)
- 1662: Virginia law where child takes mother's status
    - Better for abusing slaves so the kids would also be slaves

## Homework Questions - 8/31

1. What is the Flushing Remonstrance?
Who drafted it, why, and what is its basic message?

Settlers drafted it in 1657 in Flushing.
They wanted to petition the Dutch colonial government uphold freedom of conscience and permit religious pluralism.

2. Why do you think Governor Stuyvesant rejected the Remonstrance?
Are there any understandable or justifiable reasons for him to deny religious or ideological diversity in this new colony?

He rejected it because he would only tolerate his Dutch Reformed Church (and the Remonstrance went against that idea).

3. What has been the legacy of the Remonstrance?

It was the first document in America to argue for religious freedom.
Also the people did not just argue/petition to solve their own problems, they argued for everyone's right to choose.
It lead to Queens being one of the most divese country in the US.
However, there is no proof that later advocators for rights
(like those who wrote the Bill of Rights, Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, or the Declaration of Independence)
were influenced by the Remonstrance.

## Class Notes - 9/2

### Race is a social construct

- Constellation of features
    - Group a set of features (skin color, hair, facial structure) into a racial category
- Police boundries
    - Not nessissarly based on ancestry
        - More based on visual features

    - Man made (doesn't make it false)
    - We give value to the assumed "race"
    - Paper money based on the fact that other people think it has value/meaning
- **Essentialization**
    - Ascribing one trait to another trait
    - Renforces/strengthens social construct
        - Leads to stereotypes
    - She is good at math because she is Asian

### Power of an Illusion: Race

- "All men are created equal"
    - Had slaves
- How people assign meaning to how they look
- Notes on the State of Virginia (Thomas Jefferson)
    - Africans might be different from time/circumstance but they are inferior
- Not all are "men"
    - Justified slavery
- In early America: economic status and religion > race/skin color
    - Slow shift
- Replaced indured servants with African slave trades
    - Europeans weren't willing to come to America anymore
    - Became: "black (slaves)" and "white European (masters)"
        - Became more accepted/"natural"

### Inventing Black and White

- Fearful of African + indentured servant force
- Gave lowest "whites" more rights to distinguise them from the African slaves
    - Less likely they would unite again

1. Why was Bacon's Rebellion a turning point for the status and rights of people of African descent in Virginia?
    - Associated them with perpetral slavery
    - Worse rights
    - Now more sperated from the "whites"
2. What motivated Virginia's lawmakers to make legal distinctions between white and black inhabitants?
What effect did those distinctions have on Virginia's universe of obligation?

    - They were worried about another combined force of Africans and indentured servants (Europeans)
    - Sought to make them seperate so they could not join again
    - Not obligated towards the slaves
    - Yes, they do influence the way people think about who belongs because they are the formal written guide
        - Carries different weight
3. What does Ira Berlin mean hwne he says that freedom and slavery were created at the same moment?
How does creating an "out" group strengthen the identity and status of the "in" group?
    - Your identity is "not the out group" &rarr; desire to be in the in group
4. Not going to type question
    - Rich people could get richer
    - Easy to say:
        - Relative to me, Africans are all slaves, so Africans are meant to slaves
    - The poor whites could now say:
        - I am different that the slaves
        - Part of the group that has rich people

## Homework Questions - 9/3

1. What makes 1619 such a momentous year both for Jamestown and for American history?

In 1619, the first Africans arrived in Virginia.
They came as unwilling slaves who were stolen from their homes.
It marked the start of imported slavery that still has impact today.
Also in that year, the General Assembly (the House of Burgesses)
met for the first time, marking the beginnings of representative
government in the colonies.
(And the first women arrived in Jamestown in 1619.)

2. What, according to this article, makes American slavery unique from its global counterparts?

Slavery was permanent and hereditary.
Childern inherited their parents status so they were enslaved at birth.

3. Knowing what you know now about the history of slavery in America – from the
horrendous cruelty of slavery itself to the horrors of the Civil War to the continued civil
rights abuses and racism it spawned even after its abolition – what would you have done as
a member of Jamestown to try to avert this history from coming to fruition?

I think it would have been hard to change things.
Looking back on it, we now know much more than the people at the time.
Also, the people at that time were looking for profits and did not care about the well being of "other" (as in not their people) people.
I think the best chance for changing the course of history would be
to educate people before the imported slaves arrive that those people are still people.

### The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano, or Gustavus Vassa, The African

1. At the end of the first sentence, the author writes that the slave ship was “waiting for its cargo.”
To what cargo is he referring?

The slaves

2. Describe the conditions on board the boat, specifically those under deck.

Terrible.
Terrible smell, very compact, hot, unsanitary.

3. Why did the narrator get beaten for not eating?

So he would survive (and the owners would not lose money).

“Surely this is a new refinement in cruelty, which, while it has no advantage.”

The slaves already suffered so much, so why would they add on to the suffering by seperating the people.

Matter of fact, statements.
He seemed a bit confused.

## Homework Questions - 9/6

1. What about Benjamin Franklin’s life do you find most interesting or intriguing?

I found the fact that Benjamin created a fire department interesting.
I would not have thought that it was something that was important/needed,
but it was mentioned multiple times in the article.
I think it woul be intresting to learn more about when/how/why he created it.

2. Is there anything about his life that surprised you, perhaps even scandalized you?

I did not know he had a large family.
It surprised me that his family was not super "close".
For example when his brother would not publish his writings
and got mad when he found out how Benjamin had tricked him,
Benjamin left and moved to Philadelphia.

3. Of his many achievements, which do you consider Benjamin Franklin’s greatest and why?

I think his greatest achievement was his particpation in the creation of the Declaration of Independence.
I think it his greatest achievement because it was a very important moment for the
creation of the United States of America.

        - British tax that the colonists felt that voilated their liberty
    - Hutchinson had defended Andrew Oliver (a relative) who was helping to administor the Stamp Act
    - Led by Ebenezer Mackintosh

## The Crisis Begins

### Consolidating the Empire

- 1760: King George III takes British crown
- Saw the colonies as just a way to enrich Britain
    - Contrast from the notion of "allies" during the Seven Years' War
    - Needed a way to pay for the war
- **Virtual representation**
    - Every member represented the country as a whole, not just the area they were from
    - The colonies and even major British cities (Manchester and Birmingham) were not represented
- **Writs of assistance**
    - General search warrants to search anywhere
    - To combat smuggling (and enforce Navigation Acts)
- Also not happy with the Proclamation of 1763

### Taxing the Colonies

- 1764: Sugar Act
    - Reduced tax on molasses
    - However, further shutdown smuggling
        - Courts often sided with the smuggler &rarr; they could be judged without a trial
    - Trying to enforce Navigation Acts
        - Now colonies were taxed directly instead of indirectly on the trade
        - Affected the colonial ports the most
- Currency Act
    - Confirmed the ban of using paper as "legal tender"
        - Coins or banknotes that must be accepted if offered in payment of a debt
- Stamp Act
    - Affected everyone
    - Led to British army stationed in America to enforce
    - Displeased many of the writers and those who controlled the press
    - Displeased the local elites who lost power as a result of this
    - "Property was taken away without consent"
        - Colonists wanted the rights of an Englishman

### Taxation and Representation

- Bristish saw colonies as outposts of an empire
    - They chose the represetives in America
- The colonists saw themselves as equals to those on the mainland
- Because they were unrepresented in Parliament, they could not be taxed by it
    - "No taxation without representation"
- House of Burgesses (Virginia) under Patrick Henry passed laws arguing for "British freedom"
    - Colonists should get same rights/liberties as British citizens because they were British citizens
- 1765: **Stamp Act Congress**
    - 27 delegates from 9 colonies
    - Still loyal and obedient to the crown
    - However, right to constent of taxation was essential to the freedom of a people
    - Resulted in boycotting all British goods
        - First time the colonies worked together

### Liberty and Resistance

- "Liberty" began becoming a common topic and took many forms of visual representation
- **Committe of Correspondence**
    - In Boston
    - Before Stamp Act was passed, spread word and encourged opposition to it (and the Currency Act)
- Resistance to the acts were often started by elites, but they spread to everyone
- 1765: **Sons of Liberty**
    - NYC residents led protests and enforced boycotting of British imports
- 1766: Britain repealed the Stamp Act
    - Did not expect American resistance to it
    - Also pressured by British merchants who were losing money
        - (Couldn't sell stuff to America with the boycotts)
- However, at the same time, Britain passed the **Declaratory Act**
    - Parliament had the right to tax the colonies in any case

### The Regulators

- As colonies expanded westward, there were more conflicts
    - Land disputes between settlers, colonial governments, and Indians
    - Liberty in relation to secure possession of land
        - Compared to liberty in relation to Stamp Tax was about taxes
- **Regulators**
    - Mid-1760s
    - Wealthy residents from the South Carolina backcountry
    - Protested the under representation of western settlements
    - As well as the failure to create local governments
- At the same time, in North Carolina some small farmers rebelled
    - Kidnapped local officals and refused to pay taxes
    - Caused general disruption
- Wanted democratization of local government
    - Went against the rich and powerful (the colony's elite)
- 1771: "battle of Alamance"
    - The farmers were suppressed by the colonial militia

## The Road to Revolution

### The Townshend Crisis

- 1767: **Townshend Acts**
    - Taxed glass, lead, paint, paper, and tea
    - During the Stamp Act, some colonists had said they would be okay on taxing trade
        - Just not taxing them directly
    - Also created a board to collect the taxes and further stop smuggling
- Opposition to it came slower than the Stamp Act
    - But by 1768, some colonies reinstanted the boycotts
- Led to increased independence from Britain
    - Began producing goods within America
        - Became a symbol of resistance
        - Daughters of Liberty: homespun clothes
    - Popular especially in the Chesapeake so the planters did not have to pay as much money to British merchants
    - Also reduced competition with British merchants

    - Eventually Townshend Acts were repealed and the boycotts ended
    - Tea tax remained

### The Tea Act

- The East India Company stock collapsed
    - It had a large monopoly over trade
    - Effectively ran British India
    - Many many people had invested in it
- To help the company (and thus its supporters), the British government tried to promote it in America
    - It was given rebates and tax exemptions
        - Underpriced local tea and smugglers in America
- Colonists saw this as an extention of the Declatory Act
    - It would acknowledge the right of Britain to tax the colonies
- 1773: **Boston Tea Party**
    - Threw 300 chests of tea off a ship and into the water
    - Cost them 10,000 (about 4 million today)

    - Created local Committees of Safety
        - Implement the mandates and punish "enemies of American liberty"
        - Transfered effective political power from the colonial governments (controlled by Britain)

### The Sweets of Liberty

    - Confident in their ability to retain control
- Novemeber 1775: **Lord Dunmore's Proclamation**
    - Offered freedom to slaves who fought for the British
    - Further enraged the South against Britain
- Because of high diversity in New York and Pennsylvania, they were more hesitant to break with Britain
    - Wanted peace with Britain
    - Feared internal conflict after break with Britain (sort of predicted Civil War)

### *Common Sense*

- January 1776: ***Common sense*** by Thomas Paine

    - Argued for independence
    - Did not just repeat grievences of the colonists
        - Reached a new audience, spread it to all the people, not just the elites

## Homework - 9/17: Moment of Decision! 1776

### 1) An introduction of your character: Rebecca Howe

I am a 48 year old single mother who is the owner of this inn.
Creating this buisness was hard, and has only been harder since he died 5 years ago.
Because of this, I am thankful for any visitors I get regardless of who they are or what they believe.
My rum is made from completely legal molasses and my son is definitely not a member of the rebel militia.

You are the forty-eight-year-old owner of a public inn at which this evening’s discussion is
taking place. You and your husband worked hard to build up your business. Since his death five years ago, the
burdens on you have grown heavier. The local British magistrate is a frequent visitor to your inn, and you are
grateful for the business he brings. Of course, you do not tell him that the rum you serve is made from smuggled
molasses. You also do not dare admit that your son is a member of the rebel militia in your county. You are very
worried that he may go off to war.

### 2) An explanation of your top option: 2

My top option is option 2.
My son "is a member of the rebel militia" and I am "very worried that he may go off to war" (and die),
so I do not agree with options 3 or 4 which want us (my son) to fight.
I agree more with option 2 than than option 1 because I agree some things do need to change,
otherwise I would not even be hosting this discussion.
For example, the rum I make "is made from smuggled molasses" which I would not have to do if things were different.
However, I don't have anything particularly against the British,
and the "local British magistrate is a frequent visitor to" my inn
which provides good buisness.

While I am leaning toward Option 2, I could be persuaded to Option 1.

### 3) Generate at least one question for each of the other options

| Option | Question |
| :- | :- |
| 1 | Shortly after the Stamp Acts were repealed, we were hit by the Townshend Acts which had many of the same problems as the Stamp Acts and had the same outcome. Don't you think it's time for change now rather than just be used to help Britain? |
| 3 | While Britain could have treated us better, do you really think that it is best to risk our lives for something that could be solved with discussion? We did end up getting the Stamp Acts and Townshend Acts repealed. |
| 4 | Is it really best to leave Britain? We owe our entire existance on these lands to them. |

### 4) Look over and take notes on the bios of the other characters

Key:
- " ": No

### Other notes

#### Option 1

Beliefs and Assumptions Underlying Option 1:
1. No society on earth enjoys greater liberty and prosperity than the American colonies. Much of our good fortune, especially with respect to trade, is due to our status within the British Empire.
2. Accepting the authority o Parliament is a reasonable price to pay for Britain’s protection of the colonies
3. We are called upon by God to respect the legitimate authority of government.

Supporting Argument for Option 1:
1. The colonies will be crushed militarily and ruined economically by a full-scale war of rebellion
2. Breaking our ties with Britain will embolden the lower classes to challenge the authority of their betters
3. Without the unifying force of British rule and the protection of the British navy, the colonies will squabble among themselves and present an inviting target for aggressive foreign powers

#### Option 2

Beliefs and Assumptions Underlying Option 2:
1. The legitimacy of Britain’s authority over the colonies is grounded in the mother country’s discover, settlement and continuous protection of America.
2. The colonies should be required to contribute their fair share to defend the British Empire in North America.
3. Under the British constitutional system, the citizens of the colonies should have a voice in making the laws
that govern them, especially in the area of taxation.

Supporting Arguments for Option 2:
1. Establishing a joint British-American council—on equal footing with Parliament—to govern the colonies will protect both the rights of the colonists and the legitimate authority of Britain.
2. Resistance to British rule will bring economic disaster to the colonies.
3. Without British authority over them, the individual colonies will turn against each other and plunge into civil war.

## Homework Questions - 9/19

1. What, according to the first paragraph, is the purpose of the Declaration of Independence?

The purpose is to seperate politically from Britain and to form a new nation where the opinions of the people are respected.

2. What groups do you think Jefferson and the Continental Congress hoped to persuade with this document?

Everyone.
They hoped to pursaude the colonists to support/fight the United States of America.
And they hoped to open the eyes of everyone globally to these ideas such as unalienable rights and the consent of the governed.

3. According to Jefferson, what is the purpose of government?
Who has the right to create or establish a government?

Jefferson thought that the purpose of government was to secure and protect the unalienable rights of the people (life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness).
The people have the right to create or establish a government (or to abolish it).

4. Jefferson intended the Declaration of Independence to be universal, applying to any people or nation.
As a result, he did not mention any specific laws or actions by Britain in his list of grievances,
but rather referred to the general violation of rights they represented.
Select any five grievances mentioned by Jefferson and identify the specific law or act that lies behind that grievance.

- “For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us” = The Quartering Act
- "He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, and also uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their Public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures." = The 1774 change to the Massachusetts Charter of 1691
- "He has obstructed the Administration of Justice by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers." = Starting in 1774, the king appointed all the Massachusetts's judges
    - The judges were dependent on the king for their salaries and subject to his directions
- "He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures." = Colonists saw the soldiers as tools for the British to enforce the Stamp Act/Townshend Acts
    - And the Quartering Act after the Boston Tea Party
- "For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world". = The Navigation Acts

5. What legal means did the colonists take to try to convince the British to change their repressive policies
(think back on our timeline of events leading to the American Revolution)?
How did the king and parliament respond to these concerns (again, the timeline can be your guide)?

The colonists got the Stamp Act and most of the Townshend Acts repealed.
They also boycotted British goods.

6. What did Jefferson conclude was necessary for the colonists to do in light of these repeated responses, or what he calls these “long train of abuses and usurpations”?

Jefferson concluded that the colonists have to break from the British government
and create a new government that will actually protect and benefit the people in it.

7. Those who signed the Declaration of Independence risked everything, including, as they say at the end of the Declaration,
“our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.”
Click on one of the names of the signers of the Declaration of Independence (above) and write a brief (just a few sentences is fine) summary of who they were and, if provided, what happened to them during and after the war.

William Ellery, Rhode Island:

He went to Harvard and graduated when he was just 15 years old.
He did not find his perfect career for a while, but eventually became a lawyer.

He was appointed to the Marine committee and later helped others including the committee for foreign relations.
He held the office of judge of the Supreme Court of Rhode Island.
By 1785, he was a strong supporter of the abolition of slavery.

    - Self taught
    - Father was a congregational minister
    - 1764: married John Adams
    - Kept an eye on politics and family when he went to war
    - 1776: commented on slavery and how it did not fit with the revolutions ideals of equality
    - #1 role of women: family, but husbands did not have full power over their wives
- She was an example of how other people wanted more freedoms inspired by the revolution
    - Many did not have full freedom: slaves, indentured servants, women, Indians,l apprentices, those without property

## Democratizing Freedom

### The Dream of Equality

- The American Revolution happened on 3 levels:
    1. A fight for national independence
    2. A segment of the ongoing global battle amomg European empires
    3. A conflict over what kind of a nation free America would be
- The revolution sparked debates against other previously held beliefs/strutures
    - Saw Britain as a representation of the old way and old problems
        - Also rejected patronage, fixed status
    - Liberty became a standard to judge all institutions (both homegrown and imperial)
- "All men are created equal" went against a lot of current standing structures
    - Slavery, king over subjects, husband over wife, etc
    - Inequality was at the time a core part of life

### Expanding the Political Nation

- People in marginalized groups challenged the domination of the few in power
- After the revolution, you did not have to own property to vote
    - But husbands still had power over wifes and in the South, slavery remained
- Democracy had different meanings
    - Aristotle: a system wgere the entire people govern directly
    - Became more about better representation
        - Everyone dissuced politics and could at least have part of a say
        - Universal male suffrage, religious toleration, abolition of slavery

### The Revolution in Pennsylvania

- The prewar elites were against independence
    - Feared cutting ties would lead to them losing power and attacks on their properties
- Poltical power vacuum filled by pro-independence people from lower/middle class
    - Critized the qualifications for voting
- After the independence, Pennsylvania adopted a one house legislature
    - Elected annually by men over 21 who paid taxes
    - Removed governor and the need to own property to run for an office
    - Set up low cost schooling
    - Garenteed freedom of speech, press, and writing

### The New Constitutions

- Almost all Americans agreed to a **republic**
    - Government authority comes from the people
    - No king or hereditary aristocracy
- 1776: John Adam's *Thoughts on Government*
    - Counteract radicalism (seen by Pennsylvania)
    - Governments should be balanced between wealthy (upper house) and poor (lower house)
        - Checks and balances between the two
    - Many states adopted two house systems
    - In all but Massachusetts, the governor did not have the power to veto the legislature

### The Right to Vote

- John Adams | freedom and equality are opposites
    - Removal of property qualifications for voting would put everyone on the same level (JA | bad)
- In the South, the landed gentry retained much of the power
    - Democracy would mean they would lose power
- Universal **suffrage** did not really happen
    - Ex: Pennsylvania dropped property qualifications, but still had to pay taxes to vote
    - However, still siginificantly more people could vote

## Toward Religious Freedom

- Pre revolution: some toleration as a result of relgious pluralism
    - Not because of well formed religious toleration theories

### Catholic Americans

- The War of Independence weakened anti-Catholic feelings in America (most were Protestant)
    - Alliance with Catholic French and Spain
- Proved to the Americans that Catholics played a role in their independence
    - Full rights of an Englishman did not just apply to Protestants

### Separating Church and State

- Many were for the separating of church and state
    - Free government from religious influence and protect it from corruption
- States did not directly fund churches
    - Churchs also did not have special privileges
- Not complete
    - All states but New York barred Jews from poltical affairs
    - Massachusetts kept its Congregationalist establishment

### Jefferson and Religious Liberty

- 1779: **Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom**
    - By Thomas Jefferson for Virginia
    - 1786: Passed by House of Burgesses
    - Eliminated religious requirements for office and voting
    - Eliminated state funding of churches
    - Stopped the state from forcing a religion on someone
- Religion became an example of a private right that should be protected from government influence
    - Line between private life and public authority
- American should be an asylum for those being persecuted and oppresed of every nation and religion

### Christian Republicanism

- Merge of religious and secular struggle during the War of Independence
- Evangelical religion and republic government both belived that without moral restraint (provided by government and religion) human nature would crumble to corruption
- Some saw the American Revolution as a part of god's plan to promote the development of a good society
    - World could change (did not have to be destoryed before Christ comes)

### A Virtuous Citizenry

- Current leaders wanted to promote "virtue": sacrfice self-interest for the good of the community
- Created free state-supported schools to teach the principles of freedom
- Believed strong education was core to the future of the nation

## Defining Economic Freedom

### Toward Free Labor

- The Revolution charged the definition of freedom
    - Unfree labor was on a specturm
- The middle section rapidly declined (indentured servants and apprenticeship)
    - That work was taken up by women and blacks
    - These ideas were not compatible with republican citizenship
- But slavery remained
    - A further divide between free and slavery
    - North: free labor (wage working or owning a farm/shop)
    - South: slavery

### The Soul of a Republic

- People were caught up in the social conditions of freedom
- Some thought the government should the accumilation of property in the same of equality
    - However, others thought that equality should mean equal oppertunity
- Many leaders thought that the natural workings of society would produce justice, liberty, and equality
- Jefferson | lack economic resources = lack freedom
    - Passed laws abolishing the entail (inheritance to a specific line of heirs) and primogeniture (the eldest son inherits everything)
        - Prevent the rise of future aristocracy

### The Politics of Inflation

- The Revolution was a time of inflation
    - The government printed money to pay for the war
    - And disruption if agriculture and trade (because they were all fighting)
- Some thought the government should limit price increases
- 1776-1779: >30 mob/raids against merchants accused of holding goods off the markets

### The Debate over Free Trade

- 1779: inflation out of control
    - Congress urged states to try to fix wages and prices
        - Task of republican government was to promote public good
            - Not nessissarly individuals' self-intrests
- When the a Committee of Safety tried to control prices, it was opposed
    - **Free trade**: the government should not interfere with the market, it will regulate itself
        - Economic devolopment was a result of economic self-intrest
        - 1776: Adam Smith's ***The Wealth of Nations***
            - Invisible hand of the free market would be more fair and effective than government intervention
    - Also against it because of Navigation Acts
- Opposing views of economic freedom
    - Intrests of the community > property rights of individuals
    - Unregulated economic freedom would produce social harmony and public gain

## The Limits of Liberty

### Colonial Loyalists

- **Loyalists**: colonists who remained loyal to the British crown
    - 20-25% of the population
    - Most numerous in New York, Pennsylvania, the Carolinas, and Georgia
    - Some feared anarchy if the ties were cut, others depended on relations with Britain (lawyers, merchants, Anglican ministers, imperial officials)
- The fight for independence increased already existing social tension

### The Loyalists' Plight

- New state governments and crowds of patriots suppressed loyalists
    - Stopped newspapers though to be loyal to Britain
    - Seized loyalist property (and Quaker, Mennonites, Moravians who were pacifists and refused to fight against Britain)
    - Some states required an oath of alligence to the new nation
- At the end of the war, 60k loyalists left America either by choice or by force
- 1783: Treaty of Paris
    - Americans would not presecute loyalists and land taken during the war would be given back

### White Freedom, Indian Freedom

- Liberty for whites meant loss of liberty for Indians
    - Allowed whites the opportunity to take land from the Indians
- 1783: Treaty of Paris
    - Britain gave all rights to the land to the Americans (did not mention Indians)

## Slavery and the Revolution

- Indians experienced American independence as a real threat to their liberty
- African-Americans saw the ideals of the Revolution and the reality of war as an opportunity to claim freedom

### The Language of Slavery and Freedom

- Other than "liberty", "slavery" was the most common word in legal and political literature
- In debates over British rule: "slavery" - denial of personal/political rights by government
    - Political category
    - Lacked a say in public affairs = "enslaved"
- It was apparent that slavery did not fit with the Revolution ideals
    - Many leaders had many slaves

### Obstacles to Abolition

- Slavery was an old institution
    - Existed in every colony
    - Large part of the economy (and social structure)
- Some thought slavery of blacks enabled white freedom
    - By owning slaves it allowed whites to be economically autonomous
        - An important part of freedom

### The Cause of General Liberty

- The Revolution defined freedom as a universal entitlement
    - Not a soecific set of rights for a specific group of people
- 1700: Samuel Sewall's *The Selling of Joseph*
    - First antislavery printed in America
    - All were entitled to equal rights of freedom
        - Common idea with Pennsylvania' Quakers
- 1773: Benjamin Rush - slavery was a national crime that would result in national punishment

### Petitions for Freedom

- Slaves demanded that the leaders uphold their ideas of freedom
- **Freedom petitions**: arguments for liberty presented by enslaved African-Americans
    - Presented to New England's courts and legislatures in 1770s
- Some slaves tried to run away and pass as free borns
    - Rise of fugitive-slave advertisements rose in 1770s and 1780s
- 1776: **Lemuel Haynes**
    - Black militia member and later minister
    - If liberty was innate for all mankind, Africans were included
    - Wanted Americans to understand slavery as a denial of essential of freedom
        - Not lack of political representation
- Most slaves were only 1-2 generations from Africa
    - Did not need the Revolution's ideals of freedom
    - Their parents/grandparents were born free in Africa

### British Emancipators

- 5,000 slaves fought for American independence and got their freedom
- Many more got their freedom from the British
    - 1775: Lord Dunmore's Proclamation
    - 1779: Philipsburg Proclamation (General Henry Clinton)
        - Freedom to non-loyalist slaves who escape
    - 10s of thousands of slaves
    - 1/4 of South Carolina's slaves
    - 1/3 of Georgia's slaves
- Some escaped slaves were recaptured by the Americans
    - But still 15,000 got away
        - Went to Nova Scotia, England, Sierra Leone
- Compesation for escaped slaves hurt US-Britain relations
    - 1827: Britain paid 1,100 Americans who lost slave property

### Voluntary Emancipations

- During the War of Independence many states banned/discouraged importation of slaves from Africa
- War ruined many Southern plantations
- 1780s-1790s: slaveholders, especially Virginians and Marylanders, willing freed their slaves
    - 1796: Richard Randolph freed his slaves (~90) and gave them part of his land
- Further South, voluntary Emancipation did not really happen
    - South Carolina refused to allow slaves to fight in the war
        - Would rather lose war than lose slaves

### Abolition in the North

- 1777: Vermont banned slavery
- 1804: New Jersey also (last of the states North of Maryland to take action towards abolition)
- Mostly did not grant emancipation
    - Liberty for children born of a slave, but they often had to serve into adulthood
        - To compensate the owner's economic loss
- Abolition of slavery in the North was slow
    - 1790: first national census
        - 21,000 slaves in New York
        - 11,000 slaves in New Jersey
    - 1830: 3,500 slaves in the North
    - New Yorker John Jay - chief justice of the US: 5 slaves in 1800

### Free Black Communities

- Division over ideas of slavery seperated the North and South
- Due to abolition in the North and voluntary emacipation in the upper south, sizable number of **free blacks**
    - Often took the last names "Freeman" or "Freeland"
- 1776 &rarr; 1810: 10k &rarr; 200k free blacks in US
- Many in the North had a right to vote
- But slavery survived the independence and was still growning
- 1776 &rarr; 1790: 500k &rarr; 700k slaves in US

## Daughters of Liberty

### Revolutionary Women

- Many women contributed to the war
    - Crowd actions against merchants, raused funds to assit soldiers, made goods for the army, spied on British
    - 1782: Deborah Sampson enlisted in Continental Army
- Within households women participated in political discussions
    - Still limited by **coverture** (public politics still heavily male dominated)
        - Republican citizen basicially equaled "male"

### Republican Motherhood

- Women play the critical role of educating future citizens
    - Required themselves to have a good education
- "Companionate marriage": voluntary union and mutal dependency
    - Not male dominated
- Decline of slaves and indentured servants meant that "family" = parents children
    - Didn't include wage workers

### The Arduous Struggle for Liberty

- Plus liberty:
    - Right to vote expanded
    - Religious groups had more freedom
    - Many blacks got their freedom
    - Women (in some ways) had a higher status
- Minus liberty:
    - Indians, many loyalists, slaves
- American Revolution inspired French Revolution

## Homework Question - 9/25 - The American Revolution and Liberty

*To what extent did minority or marginalized groups (African Americans, Native Americans, women) participate in or benefit from the liberties achieved by the American Revolution?*

In this speech the Native Americans were trying to participate in the liberties
achieved by the American Revolution by asking for the right to have a say in what
happens to them/their land.
They specifically ask for the American
"surveyors and others that mark out land to cease from crossing the Ohio until we shall have spoken to you"
because they are worried about future land conflicts before a more permenent solution is in place.
They are also asking for the Americans to not nessissarly forget but to proceed
in a better than they have in the past ("We shall then bury in oblivion the misfortunes that have happened and meet each other on a footing of friendship").

The Native Americans also list a few grievances they have about what the Americans
did in the past. For example the Americans
"kindled your council fires where you thought proper, without consulting us, at which you held separate treaties, and have entirely neglected our plan of having a general conference with the different nations of the confederacy."
This directly leds them to ask for
"a treaty with you early in the spring" and "all partial treaties as void and of no effect."
They finish the speech by basically saying we offered our terms which are very fair,
but if they are not followed we will use force to defend ourselves.

# Chapter 7 - Founding a Nation

- 1788: celebration of the ratification of the Constitution
    - All celebrated (rich and poor, etc)
- US had many strengths
    - Common devotion (not by force)
    - Large size
    - Physical isolation from EU (avoid constant warring)
    - Youth population
    - Large distribution of property ownership
    - High literact rate (among white citizens)
- Many struggles
    - Did not have secure control of its land
        - British outposts near great lakes
        - Indians in the west
    - Not grant communication (other than waterways)
    - Diverse people (ethnic, religious, etc)
        - 700k slaves
        - Less common nationality

## America under the Confederation

### The Articles of Confederation

- 1777: Congress drafts the **Articles of Confederation**
    - First written US constition
    - Ratified 4 years later
    - Tried to balance control needed to coordinate during the War of Independence without widespread fear of centralized political power
        - Could do just what was needed for the war
            - Declare war, conduct foreign affairs, make treaties
            - Could not tax or regulate trade
    - More of a treaty of mutal defense than a government
        - 13 states retained individual sovereignty
        - 1 house Congress
            - Each state had 1 vote (regardless of population)
            - Decisions required 9/13 votes
        - No executive or judicial branch
    - Required 13/13 votes to amend
    - However, it did establish national control over western lands

### Congress, Settlers, and the West

- National land domain stretched to Mississippi River
    - 10,000 Indians lived in that area
- Congress decided that by supporting the British, the Indians gave up all claim to the land
    - Did not differniate between the different tribes
- 1784-1785: American governemnt got large surrenders of Indian land
    - Government was unsure what to do with the land
        - Economic health: farmers get the land
        - Or money from land sales
- After the war, many Americans moved West
    - Saw the right to take possession of Western lands as a part of American freedom
    - 1785: Ohioans petition Congress to let land ownership be given to "actual settlements"
    - Government (like the British) saw unregulated flow of Americans into Indian land as a catalyst for conflict

### The Land Ordinances

- Series of measures that defined how western land would be marketed and settled
- **Ordinance of 1784**
    - Thomas Jefferson
    - Divided the land into 3 sections that would be governed by Congress
        - Later would be admitted into the Union as states
    - Slave was allowed to continue (1 vote short of banning slavery in West)
- **Ordinance of 1785**
    - For land sales north of the Ohio River
    - Land would be surveyed and cut into 1 square mile sections
        - Land would be sold at 1 square mile at $640 ($1 per acre)
        - In each township, one section would be for public education
- **Northwest Ordinance of 1787**
    - Creation of 3-5 states north of Ohio River and east of Mississpi
    - Good treatment of Indians
        - Don't take their land
        - Some thought it would cost less to have good relations than to war against them
    - Offically banned slavery
        - Some settlers still brought slaves and lied about it
        - Increased North/South divide
- **Empire of liberty**
    - Instead of ruling the West like a colony, they would be added as equal members to the poltical system
    - High focus on self-governce of those new lands
- Americans found it difficult to regulate desire for new land
    - Something the British also struggled with
    - $640 however, was too much for most settlers
        - Until Homestead Act of 1862, people wanted lower priced land

### The Confederation's Weakness

- Economic problems
    - To pay for the war, borrowed money by selling intrest bonds or paying in notes to be redeemed later
        - However, later the government had no way to make money
            - Could not trade with West Indies (no longer a British colony)
            - Imported goods - drained money from the country
    - 1784: *Empress of China* - first US trade with Asia
        - Profitable, but did not make up for loss of West Indies trade
- States adopted own economic polices
    - Tariffs
    - Some states printed money to help people pay of debts and increase the amount of curreny in circulation
    - Some postponed debts
        - Creditors thought that was an attack on their property rights

### Shay's Rebellion

- 1786-1787: Daniel Shays led a rebellion of debt-ridden farmers in western Massachusetts
    - Farmers were upset about the state's economic policies
- Wanted to stop courts from seizing their land
- Used the same tatics used in the 1760s-1770s
- No sympathy from Governor James Bowdion
    - Dispatched an army against them
- Thomas Jefferson | A little rebellion here and there is good
    - Liberty much be refreshed every so often
- Led people to believe that the government needed to be strengthned
    - Uniform economic policies
    - Protect property rights from local majorities
    - People realized too much freedom could be an issue
        - Un checked power of the people could be bad

### Nationalists of the 1780s

- James Madison
    - Virginia, ally of Thomas Jefferson
    - Wanted to strengthen the government
- Alexander Hamilton
    - From West Indies
    - Wanted an "energetic" government
        - Allow America to be a world power
- Idea of stronger government popular with army officers, members of Congress, and diplomats
    - Also people owed money by the government, artisans who wanted tariffs, and merchants who wanted to trade with Europe
- 1786: Delagates from 6 states meet to find a better way to regulate trade
    - Proposed another gathering to amend the Articles of Confederation
        - Meet in 1787
            - All by Rhode Island attend (they already had advanced debt and trade polices)
            - Decide to start over and get rid of Articles of Confederation

## A New Constitution

- 1787: **Constitutional Convention**
    - 55 people attend
        - Smart people, wealthy, educated, slave owning
    - Held in private to ensure free debate
- At this time less than 1% of Americans attended college

### The Structure of the Government

- 3 branches - legislative, executive, judicial
- Congress would have the power to raise money (indepenant of the states)
- States could not interfere with property rights
- Goal: balance between monarchy + aristocracy and excessive democracy
- Madison: **Virginia Plan**
    - Two house legislature with state pop. determining number of reps
    - Better for bigger states
- **New Jersey Plan**
    - Single house legislature with each state having 1 vote (like AoC)
- Result: two house legislature
    - Senate: 2 votes per state
        - 6 year terms
    - House of Representatives: number of reps based on state pop.
        - 2 year terms
        - Elected by the people

### The Limits of Democracy

- Under AoC, no national officals chosen by popular vote
- HoR was an expansion of liberty
    - No property or relgious qualifications for voting
- But wanted to protect government from swigns and enthusiasms (seen in 1780s)
    - HoR kept small
        - Started at 65 reps total so that only the "right" kind of person could win a seat
    - No direct election for president or supreme court
        - President by electoral college or HoR
            - State electors by its legislature or pop. vote
    - SC elected for life
- Presidental election was complicated
    - Runner up = vice president

### The Division and Separation of Powers

- Constituion was only the outline of the structure for the government
- Based on 2 prinicples:
    1. **Federalism** - **division of powers**
        - Strong national government, weak state governments
        - President in charge of enforcing the law and the military
        - Congress could tax, regulate trade, declare war, borrow money, foregin affairs (and with Indians), and promote general welfare
        - States could not print money, interfere with property rights or contracts or interstate commerce, or tax
        - States still in charge of day to sday stuff
            - Education, police
    2. **Checks and balances** - **separation of powers**
        - Prevent any branch from becoming to OP
        - President could veto laws put by Congress
            - But 2/3 (super majority) of Congress could override
        - Supreme Court judges are nominated by president and confirmed by Sentate
        - President can be impeached by Congress

### The Debate over Slavery

- Constitution protected slavery
    - Congress can not ban importing slaves in the next 20 years
    - States had to return fugitives to their owners
    - **3/5 clause**
        - 3/5 of slavery pop. counted to HoR and electoral college pop. count
        - Signifcant power to South states
- But anti-slavery measures in place
    - Slavery not a property
    - Not national

### Slavery in the Constitution

- Its slavery clauses were a middle ground
- Slave trade in US resumed after War of Independence until 1808
    - Instantly banned further importing of slaves as soon as it could
    - But in the meantime, 170k African slaves imported
        - Replace slaves lost to British in WoI
        - Farm the new western land
- Slave laws were extraterritoriality
    - Escaped slave in a different state is still a slave and must be returned
    - Ambigious, did not say who is responsible for this

### The Final Document

- Clear simple language
- Changed language to appeal to the people as a whole unified nation

## Homework Questions - 9/27 - Ben Franklin, On the Faults of the Constitution

1. As noted in the introduction, if anyone had the right or ability to assess the merits and
shortcomings of the Constitution, it was Ben Franklin. Why then do you think he spends the
first full paragraph of his “critique” saying what he does? What is the main purpose or
message of his first paragraph?

He is saying that everyone thinks they are right and this also applies to him.
He also says he is old, which means he has much experience and wisdom,
but he is also ready to accept other people's opinions.

2. What, according to Franklin, are the Constitutions main weaknesses or its greatest
vulnerabilities? Put another way: What is the biggest threat to American democracy?

He thinks a threat to the American democracy is not doing anything.
If they stall or become "confounded" it will benefit the British.
Or if the states cannot agree and end up in conflict against eachother.

3. Was there anything about Franklin’s reflections that surprised you, stood out to you,
impressed you or disappointed you? In short, what did you find interesting, perplexing or
thought-provoking about Franklin’s remarks?

I think it is intresting that he sees a convention of men as both a positive and a negative.
He says you get the "advantage of their joint wisdom" but also "all their prejudices, their passions, their errors of opinion, their local interests, and their selfish views".
He also recognizes that it may not be possible to have drafted a better/perfect constition
because of this.

## Class Notes - 9/29

- Seperation of powers != checks and balances
- Not all powers are equal
    - Difference in total power and power to check other branches

### Seperation of powers

- 3 sections

#### Legislative

- Both houses have to approve a bill before it can become a law
    - Majority vote in both houses
        - If there is a tie in the senate, the vice president votes
        - Filibuster
            - To move from debating to voting, 60% of the senate must stop debating

#### Executive

- President
    - Head of state
        - Ceremonial, symbolic, a figure

        - Picked by president

#### Judicial

- Supreme Court
    - High culture, sets precedent
    - Top of the pyramid
- Other federal courts
    - Bricks in the pyramid (a lot more of these than SC)
    - More then just 1 level
        - If you lose a court case, you can appeal to a higher court
        - Court "curcuit"

### Checks and balances

- Make sure no body is too powerful
    - Prevent another Britain over colonies situation
- ![https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gUf71LHlRrkTDQDGLKvbs2ormGkD_2pYoLvfNFdEjjo/edit](./Unit2/ChecksAndBalances.png)

## The Ratification Debate and the Origin of the Bill of Rights

### *The Federalist*

- Constitution would go into effect when 9 states ratified it
    - (Not 13 as needed by AoC)
- Each state had elections for delegates for a ratification convention
    - Public battle to elect delegates
        - Pamplets, newspaper articles, and compaigns
- Hamilton, Madison, and Jay wrote a series of essays to convince people to ratify the constitution
    - 85 essays collected into a book (***The Federalist***)
    - Under penned name (Publius)
    - Argued that the stronger government actually further protected the rights of the people
        - Balance between liberty and power

### "Extend the Sphere"

- Madison argued that the Constitution was the designed to prevent abuses of power
- *The Federalist* nos. 10, 15 - government is subject to the will of the people, but the people are subject to dangerous enthusiasms
    - Problem of balancing democracy and respect for the rights (property rights) would only grow
        - Economic development &rarr; more poor people
        - How to stop them from using their political power to take away the property of the rich
    - Will not be a problem in the US though
        - The US's size is a strength, too large and too many conflicting interests for a single group to dominate

### The Anti-Federalists

- Against the ratification of the Constitution
    - The balance of liberty and power was too close to power
- Did not have the leaders the Federalists had
    - No one to write a book of essays
- Supported by:
    - State politicians who did not want to lose power
    - Small farmers who did not see the need for a strong government
    - Pro slavery people who either thought the Constitution limited slavery or Congress had the power to abolish it
- Thought the new government would become influenced by merchants, creditors (or other "bad" people)
    - Popular self government was better in smaller communities
    - The "common people" would become ruled by the "well-born"
- Thought the happiness of America came from the lack of limitions of the institutions and the limitations on government
- The Constitution did not have a **Bill of Rights**
    - Trial by jury, freedom of speech/press, etc were not protected
    - Madison promised that the first Congress would create a Bill of Rights
- Pro-consitution was more city/marketplace based
    - Government could improve economy
    - Anti-Federalists were more rural based
- 1787: only 12 of the 92 American newspapers were Anti-Federalist
- 1788: the 9 states required for ratification were met
    - Only Rhode Island and North Carolina were against it
        - But they didn't really have a choice)

### The Bill of Rights

- The first 10 amendements
    - 1791: ratified
- Not part of the original Constitution document
    - Freedom of speech/press/religion, equality before the law, etc
    - Madison say this as redundant and wouldn't actually help when needed ("parchment barrier")
        - But many people (Federalists and Anti-Federalists) thought it was important
1. Congress cannot limit freedom of speech, or right to assembly
    - Can not legislate against religion
2. Right to "bear arms" and militia
- Others:
    - No arrest without warrant
    - Accused does not have to testify against themselves
    - Right to trial by jury
- Relgiious freedom
    - Represents change in American society
    - The DoI was at least in part relgious
    - The Constitution is completely secular
        - No reference to God
        - No religious tests for federal officers

## Reading Questions - 10/6 - Jefferson, On Native Americans

1. What was Jefferson’s general opinion of and attitude toward Native Americans?

Jefferson truly admired the Native Americans and saw them as "a noble race who were the innocent victims of history."
Yet despite this view, it was during his time as president that "the basic decisions were made that required the deportation of massive segments of the Indian population to land west of the Mississippi."

2. What would you have recommended to Jefferson and Congress following the Louisiana Purchase to address the problem of western expansion and Native American populations?

I personally think that he should have first tried to make peace with the tribes
rather than trying to displace/deport them from their land.
I know that the Native American views on land/property/etc would make this difficult,
especially in a legal/offical way, but I think that it could have been done.
However, it is also easy to look back on a past event that we have very little emotional connection and with more modern ideas and say that it should have been done differently.
Jefferson was trying to secure the future of the American people (and I don't think he considered the Native Americans to be American people), so from his eyes, he was doing the right thing.

3. It has been argued that pushing Native Americans further west merely pushed this problem onto another generation.
What issues or difficult decisions are we as a country facing now but not taking action on and, as a result, pushing onto a future generation to resolve?
Choose an issue and briefly discuss.

I think techincally global warming was predicted as early as 1896 (or maybe it was 1938),
yet even today steps against global warming are slow and not enough.
While progess as been made, there is still a lot to be done to prevent the world from ending up like *Ready Player One*.
This can be seen by Hurricane Ian, which caused great damage to Florida and killed many people.

### Madison and Pressure for War

- Jeffersion was easily reelected in 1804
    - James Madison, Jefferson's picked sucessor won an easy victory in 1808

    - Many tribes tried to revitalize Native American life
- Militant message spread by **Tecumsech** and **Tenskwatawa** (brothers)
    - Tecumsech - Shawnee chief
        - 1795: Refused to sign Treaty of Greenville
        - Spread message that there were 2 options for the natives: resistance or extermination
    - Tenskwatawa - Shawnee prophet
        - | Complete seperation from whites
            - They were the source of all evil
        - Gathered followers in Prophetstown (Indiana)

        - And imposed a blockage that massively crippled the US
    - 1814: Napoleon defeated and Britain invaded the US

    - No statements on impressment or shipping rights
- Complete US control over lands East of the Mississippi River
    - Many settlers moved West

### The War of 1812 and the Canadian Borderland

- Attempted US invasions caused Canadians to become anti-American
    - Even if goods/ideas flowed over the border, ideas of nationalism formed against the US

### The End of the Federalist Party

## The Triumph of Democracy

### Property and Democracy

- Challenge to property qualifications for voting began during the American Revolution
- No state after the orginal 13 had property qualifications for voting
    - 1860: only 1 state had property requirements for voting
- Reflection of individualism
    - Independence now from ownship of one's self, not ownership of property

### The Dorr War

- Rhode Island required voters to own real estate at $134 or rent for $7 a year
- Rhode Island was a large manufacturing state

    - Drafted a new state constitution
    - All white men can vote
        - And all blacks could not
- Ratified the new constitution in an extralegal referendum and inaugurated Thomas Dorr as governor
    - President John Tyler dispatched federal troops
- Movement collapsed and Dorr spend 2 years in prison
    - Showed the passion around voting rights

### Tocqueville on Democracy

    - Political institutions defined people's identities
        - Not religion, ethnicity, or geography
- Alexis de Tocqueville's ***Democracy in America***
    - An account of a society in the midist of political transformation
    - Democracy was more than just the right to vote or a set of political institutions
        - It was a culture of equality, individual initative, and an active public sphere

    - Shift in ideology
        - Founders of the US tried to protect the government from the exessive influence of the people
            - Electoral College, Supreme Court, etc.

### The Information Revolution

- Steam power could be used with the printing press
    - Led to "penny press", 1 cent newspapers
- Newspapers began to try to appeal to the masses
    - Emphasized sensationalism
        - Crime, scandal, offical misconduct, etc.
- 1840: The amount of newspapers in circulation was greater in the US than in Europe

    - *The Liberator* - Abolitionist newspaper
    - *Cherokee Phoenix* - first Native American newspaper
    - *Philadelphia Mechanic's Advocate*

    - Gender and racial differences were seen on a hierarchy
- 1920: Constitution requires states to allow women to vote
- 1965: Voting Rights Act
    - Ended restrictions against on black voting in many southern states

### A Racial Democracy

- Blacks were increasingly considered to be part of a different group
- Racist imagery became popular
    - Common in theatre plays where whites would portay black characters as stupid/dishonest
    - Most litterature ignored blacks or presented them as inferior stereotypes
        - Exception: Herman Melville's *Moby Dick* and *Benito Cereno*
- Based on "science" that they were superior
- Only Virginia, South Carolina, and Georgia offically barred blacks from voting
    - But custom often made it hard for free blacks to exercise the **franchise**
- 1800: no norther state barred blacks from voting
    - But every new state after 1800 (other than Maine) limiting voting to white males
    - 1799: Kentucky no longer allowed free blacks to vote
        - 1801: Maryland follows suit
- Race replaced class as the main division between politically free and not

## Nationalism and Its Discontents

### The American System

- The fact that the US "tied" the War of 1812 against the British, the world's best military, led to a sense of national pride
- The War of 1812 also showed how far the US was from being a full nation
    - 1811: The charter for the Bank of the United States ended
        - The US had no uniform currency and it was hard to raise funds for the war effort
    - Bad transportation within the country
        - Hard to move men and goods
            - 75 days to travel between New Orleans and New England
    - US manfunctures who thrived when British trade was suspended struggled when the war ended
        - Younger Republicans called for these manufatures to be protected by tariffs
            - Same people who called for war
            - Henry Clay, John C. Calhoun
- 1815: President Madison puts forward his **American System**
    - Blueprint for government promoted economic development
    1. New national bank
    2. A tarriff on imported goods
    3. Federal financing for roads and canals
        - Promote unity
    - 1817: The bill for roads/canals was ready to be passed, but Madison vetoed his own plan
        - Worried that not following strict constitutionalism would harm southern intrests and be dangerous for individual liberty
    - 1816: The **tarriff of 1816**
        - Part of the plan that was not stopped
        - Protection for US made goods
            - Especially cheap cotton textiles
        - Tax-free on goods that could not be made in the US
    - 1816: New Bank of the United States
        - 20 year charter

### Banks and Money

- The Second Bank of the United States (SBotUS) was not loved by the people
    - A private, profit-making corporation
    - Acted as the government's financial agent, issuing paper money, collecting taxes, paying government debt
- Also in charge of making sure the money issued by local banks had actual value
    - Paper money was just a note that could be turned into a specific amount of "specie" (gold or silver)
        - Because banks printed more money than the specie they had, the value of money fluctuated
            - SBotUS was supposed to fix this

### The Panic of 1819

- SBotUS instead particpated in the speculative "fever" that followed the War of 1812
    - The US resumed trade with EU which created a demand for US goods
    - Rapid westward expansion created a demand for loans
        - Especially in the South to fuel the Cotton Kingdom
        - SBotUS and local banks printed a lot of money
- 1819: EU demand for US returned to normal levels
    - SBotUS (and then state banks) asked for the money they loaned back
        - Farmers and buisnessmen could not pay it back and declared bankruptcy
            - Unemployment rose (especially in the East)
- The **Panic of 1819** lasted only a year
    - Disrupted economic harmony
    - Many states (especially in the West) suspended the collection of debts
        - Kentucky created a state bank that printed money forced creditors to accept in plac eof the loans
        - Helped indebted farmers, but hurt those who had loaned money
    - Increased distrust of banks and massively hurt the SBotUS's reputation
        - The SBotUS was blamed for causing the panic
- Several states resisted the SBotUS by taxing its local branches
    - 1819: **Mculloch v. Marland**
        - Also judged by John Marshall
        - Marshall | The SBotUS was a legitimate use of the necessary and proper clause
            - Against the strict constitutionalism ideas

### The Missouri Controversy

- 1816: James Monroe defeats Federalist Rufus King
    - His 2 terms were called the **Era of Good Feelings** because there was only really one political party
        - But instead of 2-party competition, there was sectional conflicts
- 1819: Missouri wanted to draft a constitution so it could be added to the union as a state
    - Missouri was created in the land from the Louisiana Purchase
    - Missouri already had 10,000 slaves
        - James Tallmadge (Republican from New York) | No further slaves into Missouri and all slave children would be free when they reached 25
            - Split among sectional lines
                - North for, South against
            - Passed in the HoR, but not in the Senate
        - 1820: **Missouri Compromise**
            - Jesse Thomas | Missouri would be admitted as a slave state, but Maine would be admitted as a free state
            - It would maintain the sectional balance of free and slave states=
            - Also slavery would be banned in all Lousiana Purchase territory north of the 36°30' parallel
            - Sort of "stalled" the issue of slavery

## Nation, Section, and Party

## Reading Questions - 10/18 - The Era of Good Feelings

### Jefferson on “The Missouri Compromise” (1820)

1. What historical event or events lie behind this passage?
That is, what prompted Jefferson to write it?
Note: Please don’t just name the event, but describe it with reference to specific information (and page numbers) from Give Me Liberty!.

The main event is Missouri's attempt to join the union as a slave state.
The Missouri Compromise was passed in 1820, which allowed Missouri to join as a slave state,
but Maine to join as a free state.
This was done to maintain the balance of free and slave states.
The compromise also banned slavery in all Lousiana Purchase territory north of the 36°30' parallel (pg. 287-288).
But this sort of stalled the issue of slavery, delaying the resolution of the slavery issue.

2. What seems to be the underlying concern in this passage for Jefferson?
What does he say about this concern?
Cite specific words or lines in your response.

Jefferson's main argument is that this compromise is not actually solving the issue.
He says "this is a reprieve only, not a final sentence" and "every new irritation will mark it deeper and deeper."
This problem will only get worse as its resolution gets delayed.

3. If you were asked to make a t-shirt for sale in the Monticello gift shop, what quote
or partial quote would you include that captures the essence of this passage?

"we have the wolf by the ear, and we can neither hold him, nor safely let him go"

It would make a good piece of art, and it shows how this is complicated problem that won't solve itself.

### Excerpt from “The Monroe Doctrine” (1823)

1. Similar to above, what historical events or circumstances lie behind this passage?
(As before, describe the historical circumstances with reference to specific information and page numbers from Give Me Liberty!.)

The Monroe Doctrine was written in 1823, and was a response to the Spanish-American revolutions.
The Latin American revolutions were similar to the US rebellion and found much sympathy in the US.
It was written by John Quincy Adams who was worried that Spain (a European power) was going to try to retake its lost colonies (pg. 288-289).

2. What is Monroe’s main point or message in his so-called “Doctrine”?
In other words, what does he say is the US’s posture or attitude toward European powers?
Cite specific words or lines in your response.

One of the main points is that the US has not and will not interfere in European wars.
The Doctrine reads "in the wars of the European powers in matters relating to themselves we have never taken any part, nor does it comport with our policy to do so."
The Doctrine also says "we should consider any attempt on their part to extend their system to any portion of this hemisphere as dangerous to our peace and safety".
This shows how the US will try to prevent European powers from interfering with the newly created Latin American Republics.

3. You’ve been asked by the James Monroe Museum and Memorial Library gift shop to make a t-shirt that embodies the Monroe Doctrine.
What quote or partial quote would you include that captures the essence of this passage?
They want you to go all the way with this one and provide a graphic for your quote:
What image would you include on your t-shirt to accompany the quote or partial quote you identified?
(You don’t need to draw anything, just describe the graphic you would include.
Make it good, the James Monroe Museum could use the advertising and revenue!)

"declare that we should consider any attempt on their part to extend their system to any portion of this hemisphere as dangerous to our peace and safety"

The artwork could be a giant figure (Monroe) standing over the Americans with a shield, protecting the Americans from the European powers.

            - And with farmers near rivers, canals, and the Great Lakes
                - Benefited from internal improvements and economic changes

### Public and Private Freedom

- Democrats | Liberty = private rights best secured by local governments and endangered by national government
    - Jackson lowered expenditures, the tarriff, killed the national bank, and did not give federal aid for internal improvements
        - States replaced the federal government as main economic actors

    - Popular with evangelical Protestants

### South Carolina and Nullification

- Despite Jackon's main idea of states > federal, his first term was the opposite
- Tariff of 1828: Protective tarriff that raised taxes on imported manufactured goods of wool and iron
    - A lot of opposition in the South (especially South Carolina) where there was as large relience on imported manufactured goods
        - Tarriff was called the **Tarriff of Abominations**
        - Tarrriff only benefitted the North
            - Legislature threated to "nullify" it within their state
- SC was controlled by large slave owning planters
    - Part of this struggle was they thought that the federal government would eventually abolish slavery

### Calhoun's Political Theory

- John C. Calhoun switched from being a nationalist in 1812 to a defender of southern sectionalism in 1828
- Was VP in 1828
    - Worked behind the scenes
        - Secretly drafted ***Exposition and Protest***, a document that defended the right of states to nullify federal laws
- The national government was created by and agreement by sovereign states
    - Each with maintained the right to prevent the enforcement of laws made by Congress that exceeded its constitutional authority
- However, Calhoun had little influence
    - Mostly dominated by Van Buren
    - Calhoun was first set agaist Jackson over C's wife critizing the secretary of war (sow)'s wife, but J sympathized with sow
- 1830: **Webster-Hayne Debate**
    - Daniel Webster, senator from Massachusetts, responds to Robert Hayne, senator from SC and dispiple of Calhoun

    - Some states passed laws condeming SC's action
- Jackson | Nullification = disunion
- 1832: Tarriff of 1832
    - Lowered tarriff, but still too high for SC, so they delcare it null and void

- 1833: Henry Clay + Calhoun create a new lower tarriff
    - SC backs down, but does nullify the Force Act
    - Calhoun switches from Democrat to Whig

### Indian Removal

- 1830: **Indian Removal Act**
    - Provided funds for moving the Five Civilised Tribes
        - Cherokee, Chicksaw, Choctaw, Creek, Seminole

        - These 5 tribes tried to assimilate
            - Created schools, written laws and consitution, farming, slave owning
            - Jackson | They are still savages
- 1832: Creek nation sent message to Congress on Alabama's oppression of them
    - Wanted to maintain their own "nation" rather than be an American
        - Cultural independence, possesion of ancestral lands
    - Went to Supreme Court to protect their rights and guarantee treaties with the federal government

### The Supreme Court and the Indians

- 1823: *Johnson v. M'Intosh*
    - Supreme Court | Indians did not own their land, but had a "right of occupancy**
- 1831: *Cherokee Nation v. Georgia*
    - Marshall | Indians are "wards" of the federal government
        - Indians should have regard and protection, but they are not citizens
            - So the Supreme Court can not enforce their rights and Georgia could claim jurisdiction over the tribe
- 1832: ***Worcester v. Georgia***
    - Supreme Court | Indian nations are a distint people with their own seperate political identity
        - Must be dealt with by the federal government
            - Opposite of 1831 case
            - Partially because Marshall wanted a stronger federal government
- Jackson refused to accept the 1832 ruling
    - One tribe ceded, but they rest organized under John Russ and adopted a policy of passive-resistance
    - Federal soldiers forcefully removed them during Van Buren's presidency (Andrew Jackson's sucessor)
    - 1838-1839: **Trail of Tears**
        - 1/4 of Indians died on removal route from Georgia to Oklahoma
- Most southern tribes went peacefully
    - But the Seminoles of Florida resisted
        - 1835-1842: The Second Seminole War
            - First war was before American aquisition of Florida
            - 1,500 of each side died
            - 3,000 Indians and 500 Blacks were forced to move West
- Confirmed racial defenition of American nationhood and freedom
    - 1840: Indians were part of the past to many eyes

## The Bank War and After

### Biddle's Bank

- The Bank symbolized the hopes and fears of the market revolution
    - The Bank helped finance economic development
    - But many (including Jackson) distrusted bankers as "nonproducers"
        - Renforced by the banks constant overissuing of paper money which hurt wage workers
- Head of the Bank: Nicholas Briddle of Pennsylvania
    - 1820s: Effectivly limited overissuing of paper money by local banks and created a stable currency for the nation
    - Strong willed/aristocratic/snobbish - clashed with Jackson
        - 1832: Claimed that his Bank could destory and state bank
            - Caused distrust that anything/anyone could have such power
            - Now deemed "Monster Bank"
- 1832: Biddle asks for 20 years extension for the Bank's charter
    - It would end in 1836 otherwise
    - Jackson | this is blackmail
        - If he did not sign, the Bank would use its resources/influence to oppose reelection
- Jackson's response relfected how he enchanced the power of the president
    - President was now the symbolic representative of all the people
    - Used the veto power as a major weapon
    - Appealled directly to the people for public support over the head of Congress
        - Easliy won reelection in 1832

### Pet Banks, the Economy, and the Panic of 1837

- 2 groups were happy with Jackon's decivsion to kill the bank
    1. State banks who wanted freedom from Biddle's control to print more paper currency (**soft money**)
    2. People who opposed all banks and believed only gold and silver were reliable currency (**hard money**)
- Jackson did not want to wait until 1836 for the Bank to die
    - He moved all federal funds into local banks
        - Called **pet banks** because poltical/personal relations determinted Jackson's choices
        - 2 secretaries of the Treasury refused to move the funds because the laws creating the banks said that governemnt funds could only be removed for a good cause
            - Jackson fired them and hired Roger Taney, who did not have the same scruples
                - 1835: Marshall dies and Jackson promotes Taney to chief justice
- 1833 &rarr; 1837: $10 million &rarr; $149 million bank notes in cirrculation
    - "Real wages" (effective/actual value of wages) declined
        - Labor unions form
        - Speculators rush to cash in on rising land prices
            - Using paper money, bought up public land and resold to farmers

    - At the same time, the Bank of England demanded that American merchants pay in gold/silver
        - BoE as suspicous of the US economy
        - Shortly after, economic downturn in Britain reduced demand for American cotton
- 1837: **Panic of 1837**

![The Industrious Man](./Unit3/TheIndustriousMan.jpg)

I found this image intresting because nothing is really happening.
In other images we have seen, the message was more clear.
For example Paul Revere's engraving of the Boston Massacre or criticisms of Andrew Jackson.
However this image implies that the wife should be at home with the kids, but the husband is free to go out and come back.
This image shows the cult of domesticity and how the husband could move between public and private "spheres" while the wife was stuck in the private sphere.

## Homework - 10/29

![iPhone](./Unit3/iPhone.jpg)

According to [listverse.com](https://listverse.com/2014/12/16/10-everyday-products-that-are-made-with-slave-labor/),
some electron deivces, such as iPhones, are made by people working in bad conditions.
The process of making this phone is different that slave labor pre-Civil War.
While some of the motivations are the same, for example how to make the most profit,
this is hidden from the world.
Before the Civil War, slavey was a fairly open thing.
There was a slave trade, and people openly supported slavery.
Now, everyone knows this is wrong, so it is hidden.
For example in 2014 there was a fire in a factory in Bangladesh.
The management locked the employees into the burning building
becuase "the potential scrutiny from all of those people rushing out of the building worried them more than those people’s safety" (listverse).

## Homework Questions - 11/3: The Declaration of Sentiments

1. Why do you think the participants at Seneca Falls used the language and structure of the Declaration of Independence for articulating their appeal?

The participants at Seneca Falls used the language and structure to draw similarities between the unequal treament of women and the unequal treatment of colonists by the British.
They wanted to show that the ideals presented in the Declaration of Independence was not just for the men, but for all people.
Also, during this time there was a lot of debate about the antislavery movement which also used the Declaration of Independence to show that equality and freedom were for all in America.

2. Is there anything that the Declaration is asking for that strikes you as particularly interesting or surprising?

I found the second to last paragraph instresting.
The main point of it is to say that the men taking away women's confidence and their self-respect.
I found this argument instresting because it is saying that men are are enforcing their control by limiting what women believe they have the right to.
It also shows that part of the goal of this Declaration is to point out all the rights that are currently being denied to them.

## Homework - 11/2: Reform Movement Roundtable

- Your character’s personal background, especially anything that might explain their involvement in their particular reform movement
- The specific issue or issues your character is concerned about and wanting to change

### [**Horace Mann**](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Horace-Mann)

Horace Mann grew up in an environment ruled by poverty, hardship, and self-denial. While he was taught briefly and erratically by comparatively poor teachers, he was able to find tutoring from Samuel Barrett and to educate himself in the Franklin town library. His keenness and depth of perception and oratorical skill soon won him a seat in the Massachusetts House of Representatives, where he served from 1827 to 1833. Of the many causes Mann supported, including antislavery and more humane treatment of the insane, the most important to him was popular education. While Massachusetts has had a public school system since 1647, during Mann’s lifetime, the quality of education had deteriorated as school control had gradually slipped into the hands of economy-minded local districts. Mann helped establish a state board of education. The board had little direct power, so Mann started the Common School Journal in 1838 for teachers and began to lecture to interested groups of citizens. Personifying and describing education in an 1848 issue of the journal, Mann wrote “when she goes forth, like a puissant goddess, and speaks deliverance to captive nations from their hereditary and long-transmitted bondage to ignorance; when she drives away … the vampires of superstition, that have sucked the life blood from the hearts of men; when she turns wildernesses and jungles into habitable lands.” Mann believed that a republic cannot remain ignorant and free, thus universal popular education was necessary. He also believed that universal education could restore equality by bringing all children together and allowing the less fortunate to have a chance to climb the social ladder. In 1853, Mann accepted the presidency of Antioch College, a new institution committed to coeducation, nonsectarianism, and equal opportunity for African Americans.

## Homework - 11/9: Election 2022

What was the office or issue up for a vote?
How did it turn out?
What is the significance or consequence of this vote?
Finally, as part of your reflection, respond to the following:
"What would ___________ think about America/American democracy based on this particular issue or the election more generally?"
where the blank is anyone we've studied so far, whether a president, cabinet or congressional member, war hero, reformer, etc.

I am looking at the 2022 election results for Nevada Question 3: establish open primaries and ranked choice voting.
With 77% votes in (816,859), 51.5% voted yes (420,838) and 48.5% voted no (396,021).
If this passes, elections (in Nevada) would change to a system of open primaires, allowing voters to select candidates from any party
and would be used to narrow down all candidates to the top five candidates.
The voters would then rank as many of the candidates they want in order of their preference.
I think George Washington would support this change because he was strongly againt political parties.
This change would allow voters to vote for the candidates they want, not the candidate of a party they are a part of.

    - Had to mine underground
        - Required investment of captial
- This economic change worsened conflicts between the different racial/ethnic groups
    - White miners created groups that denied/expelled forein miners from areas with gold
        - Mexicans, Chileans, Chinese, French, and American Indians
    - The state legislature created a $20/month tax on forgein miners
        - Drivening them out of the state
- For the California's Indians, the gold rush and absorption into the US was a disaster
    - Gold seekers overrun Indian communities
    - Miners, ranchers, and vigilantes murdered 1,000s of Indians
        - State officals created bounties to private militia to attack the Indians
        - Although California was a "free state" Indian childern declared orphans or vagrants were bought and sold as slaves
        - 1860: California Indian pop. 30,000
            - From 150,000 when the Mexican war ended

### Opening Japan

- The Mexican War gave the US East facing ports (sail to the East by going West)
    - 1848-1860: US-China trade tripled
- 1850s: The US wanted to open Japan to international trade
    - Japan closed itself off for 2 centuries

        - Asked to make a treaty by President Millard Fillmore, Perry demanded that the Japanese make a deal
            - Worried about European invasions into China, impressed by Perry's naval tech, and impressed by a show put on demonstrating blackface, Japan agreed
            - 1854: Opened 2 ports to US trade
                - And Japan launched a program of modernization

    - Sam Houston elected first president of Texas
- All of this was Mexican history until US annexation Texas

### Annexation of Texas

- Texas was worried that Mexico would try to retake it
    - Annexation by the US would protect them from Mexico
    - Texas was also struggling as a new country
- Most Southerners/Democrats supported Texas’ annexation, Northerners/Whigs were opposed
    - It would break the balance of free and slave states
- 1843: Santa Ana warned that annexation of Texas would be “equivalent to a declaration of war against the Mexican Republic.”
    - Mexico was okay with Texas being "independent" just not part of the US
- 1845: Republic of Texas voted to be annexed by the United States Congress approved
    - Texas became 28th state

### War with Mexico

- Began over dispute of southern boundary of Texas

- Back then, the USA ~= Mexico
    - USA was still more powerful, but not by much
- Polk wanted more than just Texas
    - Elected on platform of Manifest Destiny
    - Wanted to acquire entire western Mexican territory

- Party’s platform stated: “the re-occupation of Oregon and the re-annexation of Texas at the earliest practical period are great American measures”
    - Louisiana Purchase + Manifest Destiny = the West was already the US

### Failed Diplomacy

        - Saving face
            - We are actually buying this from you
            - We didn't just roll over you
    - ![Mexican Cession 1843](./Unit4/MexicanCession1843.png)
        - Cession != Secession
- Why stop at just that?
    - Issue of slavery
    - Would mean that American would now include a lot Catholic Mexcians

### Gadsden Purchase

- U.S. considered a southern route for a transcontinental railroad
    - The Arizona land from the Mexican Cession of 1843 was too mountainy to make an easy railroad
- 1853: Mexico sold 30,000 square miles of southern New Mexico and Arizona to U.S. for $10 million.

### New American Territory

- New US territory
    - Larger than Louisiana Purchase
    - Sparsly populated, but not empty
        - 75,000-100,000 Spanish Speaking Mexicans

    - Russia, Britain, US, Mexico/Spain
    - By 1818, it was really just US and Britain
        - Neither side wanted to go to war (just had War of 1812)
        - But they were both unwilling to give up a chance to get the land
- Treaty of 1818
    - Established “Joint-Occupancy” of Oregon Territory between British and U.S. for 10 years
    - Established 49th parallel as northern border to the “Stony Mountains” (Rockies)
        - Loose border

### Fredrick Jackson Turner

- Turn of the century American historian
- “The Significance of the Frontier in American History” (1893)
- Claimed the frontier had played a key role in shaping the American character (“rugged individualism”)
- Frontier life created Americans that were socially mobile, ready for adventure, bent on individual self-improvement, and committed to democracy
    - (West = America) = (America = World) = (young, new, free, independent = the standard)
- The West was a sort of “pressure valve”

##### Part 2

"For it is not light that is needed, but fire; it is not the gentle shower, but thunder. We need the storm, the whirlwind, and the earthquake. The feeling of the nation must be quickened; the conscience of the nation must be roused; the propriety of the nation must be startled; the hypocrisy of the nation must be exposed; and its crimes against God and man must be proclaimed and denounced."

- "Your independence"
    - Not liberty and justice for **all**
        - Just for whites

## A Dose of Arsenic

- The acquisition of new US land once again raised the issue of slavery in the west
- 1844-1845: Methodist and Baptists divide into north and south branches
    - The 2 largest evangelical churches
    - Example of the bonds of Union fraying

### The Wilmot Proviso

- Before 1846: Status of slavery in the US settled by state law or Missouri Compromise
    - New land acquired from Mexico was not settled
- 1846: Congressman David Wilmot of Pennsylvania proposed that slavery should be banned in in all land from Mexico
    - Political party lines crumbled as all the northerners (Whigs and Democratics) supported it
        - While all southerners opposed it
    - Passed in the House (where there are more northerners) but not the Senate (even number of slave and free states)
- 1848: Opponents of slavery create the **Free Soil Party**
    - Nominate Van Buren for president and Charles Francis Adams as running mate (son of JQA)
        - MVB partly because of revenge for jettisoning him in 1844

    - Believed that the settlers in the states should decide
- 1848: President = Taylor, hero of the Mexican War and sugar planter
    - MVB got 300,000 votes (14%)
        - Showed that slavery spread past just the abolishtionitsts

### Crisis and Compromise

- 1848: "Springtime of nations"
    - Democratic uprising against monarchies of Europe
    - Demands from ethic minorities for self-determination
    - Example of: American ideals of liberty and self-government spreading
    - Chartist movement in Great Britain organized massive demonstrations in support of democratic reforms
    - French monarchy &rarr; republic
    - Hungarians revolt against Austria
    - Italian and German unification
- Short lived
    - Chartism ended quickly
    - Emperor Napoleon III of France restored monarchy
    - Budapest, Rome, and other revolts were crushed
- Worried Americans that their liberty could also be short lived
    - Slavery was more and more of an issue
    - 1850: California asks to be admitted into the Union as a free state
        - South | Would upset balance in Senate
        - **Compromise of 1850**
            - California admitted as a free state
            - Slave trade (not slavery itself) was abolished in the capital
            - New law to help South with runaway slaves
            - Status of slavery in Mexican Succession land would be left to their white inhabitants
            - US would pay the debt Texas accumulated while trying to be independent

### The Great Debate

- Webster (Massachusetts) | Willing to give up Wilmot Proviso for this compromise
- Calhoun (South Carolina) | Rejected the compromise
    - | North must yeild
- William H. Seward (New York) | Opposed compromise
    - | Morality > Constitution
        - | Issue of slavery should not depend on laws, it is just wrong
    - Voice of abolitionism in the Senate
- President Taylor | Just admit California to the Union
    - Suddenly died in 1850
        - Replaced by Millard Fillmore (New York) who supported the compromise
            - Secured adoptation of the compromise

### The Fugitive Slave Issue

- The new **Fugative Slave Act** of 1850 was controversial
    - Citizens could be called on to help capture runaway slaves and return them to their owners
    - Made it a crime to help runaway slaves
    - Special federal commissioners determined the fate of alleged fugitives without jury trial or testimony
    - Example of: South supporting strong federal intervention rather than state rights
        - Eo: Security of slavey > consisitency of the "state's rights" principle
- 1850s: 300+ federal tribunals and 157 slaves returned to the South
    - At the government's expense
- Fruther divided the North and South
    - And further strengthed the Underground Railroad
        - Consolided the northern part and was able to use railroads to bring them to Canda
        - 1855-1856: Sydeny Howard Gay documented the Underground Railroad and 200 people shuffled from Philadelphia to Canada and New York
- Fugatives, aided by abolitionists, sometimes violently resisted recapture
    - 1851: A crowd resuced escaped slave, Jerry, from jail in Syracuse and brought him to Canada
    - 1851: Owner killed trying to recapture a slave in Pennsylvania
- In general, many fugatives and free blacks rushed to Canada
    - Against the image of US = asyulm for freedom/the oppressed

### Douglas and Popular Sovereignty

- 1852 eletion
    - Democrat Franklin Pierce rolled Whig Winfield Scott
        - Ran on the idea that the compromise = resolution of the slavery issue
- 1854: Stephen Douglas proposed Nebraska and Kanas added to the Union from Lousisana Purchase land
    - Douglas wanted a transcontinental railroad to support western development
    - South | this will further disrupt Senate balance
    - Douglas propsed that the new states decide status of slavery based on popular sovereignty
        - Decide by local settlers not Congress
        - Douglas | This is a balance between the extremes of the North and South

### The Kansas-Nebraska Act

- These lands where the in the middle of the US
    - Directly in the path of westward expansion
- Slavery should be banned in these lands based on the Missouri Compromise
    - Douglas's plan would repeal the Missouri Compromise
        - In response, a group of abolitionist congressmen issued the *Appeal of the Independent Democrat*
            - | The Missouri Compromise was a "sacred compact" and should not be repealed
            - | This was an attempt to turn free territory into despotic slave territory
            - Convinced Northererns that all the South wanted was to spread slavery into the West
- 1854: **Kansas-Nebraska Act**
    - Reorganized American poltics
        - Shattered the demotricatic party
        - At the same time, the Whig party collapsed as it was unable to come up with a unified response
        - Result:
            - South = Democratic Party
            - North = new Republican Party
                - Whigs + unhappy democrats
                - Goal: prevent expansion of slavery

## The Rise of the Republican Party

### The Northern Economy

- The rise of the republican party reflected the economic and social changes in the North
    - Completion of the market revolution
    - Beginning of mass immigration from Europe
- 1843-1857: Economic growth
    - Especially in the North
    - Result of the completion of the railroad network
        - 1848 &rarr; 1860 = 5,000 &rarr; 30,000 miles of railroad
        - In Ohio, Illinois, and Old Northwest
        - Completed Northwest's trade's shift from South to the East
            - Farmers no longer shipped goods on Mississippi River
                - Instead used the railroads to send it directly to the East at a much cheaper cost
    - Increased economic integration between the Northwest and the Northeast
        - Groundwork for political unification of the Republican Party
- Most northerners lived in small towns/rural areas
    - But most did not work in agriculture
- 2 main areas of industrial production
    - Atlantic coast and Great Lakes area
    - Driven by coal mining and iron manufacturing

### The Rise and Fall of the Know-Nothings

- 1854: Nativism turned into a political party
    - Hostility to immigrants, especially Catholics
    - Started meeting in secret and would answer "I know nothing" when asked about it's existence
- **Know-Nothing Party** main idea: reserve political offices for native bornb Americans and resisit the Catholic Church undermining American values and education
    - Quickly swept through Massachusetts
    - Against the Kansas-Nebraska Act
    - Also sometimes pro-prohibition
- Didn't really have a lasting effect
    - The immigrants from Europe where white and usually male
        - By this time basically automatically gained the right to vote

### The Free Labor Ideology

- 1856: Republican Party = anti-slavery Democrats + northern Whigs + Free Soilers + Know-Nothings
    - Claimed difference from "free society" and "slave society" showed the North as the home of progress, opportinuty, and freedom
- Opposed slavery on the idea of "free labor"
    - Each labor had the opportinuty to move up the ladder to land owning farmer, independent craftsman
        - Become economically independent (which = freedom)
    - While in the South there were only slaves degraded to below human, poor whites with no hope of improvement, and idle aristocrats
        - Republicans | If slavery spread to the West, it would become like the South, and people would not benefit from it
            - | Slavery must be kept out of the West to allow free labor to flourish
- Republicans != abolitionists
    - Wanted to stop the spread of slavery, noot fully remove it from the country
    - However, many saw the nation's division into free and slave societies as something that would have to be addressed

### "Bleeding Kansas" and the Election of 1856

- The idea of free labor resonated well in the North and lead to the quick rise of the Republican Party
- 1854-1855: 100s of pro-slavery Missourians crossed the border into Kansas to cast fraudulent ballots
    - Kansas-Nebraska Act: made status of slavery depend on popular sovereinty (pop. vote based)
- President Franklin Pierce recognized the legitimacy of the resulting proslavery legislature
    - In response, settlers from free states established a rival government
    - A civil war in Kansas breaks out
        - 200 people die
        - 1856: proslavery mob attacks free-soil strong hold of Lawrence and burn public buildings and pillgage private homes
- **Bleeding Kansas** discredicted Douglas's policy of leaving the status of slavery up to the local population
    - Further helped the Republican Party
        - (Also in Congress, Preston Brooks (South Carolina) beat Charles Sumner (Massachussetts) unconscious with a cane)
- Election of 1856 - parties:
    - Republicans: John C. Fremont
        - Ideal: Stop expansion of slavery
    - Democrats: James Buchanan
        - Was in Great Britain in 1854 and had no relation to the Kansas-Nebraska Act
        - Ideal: Popular Sovereignty will solve the slavery issue
    - Know-Nothings: Millard Fillmore
- Election of 1856 - result:
    - Fremont wins big in North
        - 11 of 16 free states
        - Democrats weaken
    - Buchanan wins big in South
        - All of the South + Illinois, Indiana, and Pennsylvania
            - Enough to secure the presidency
            - Republicans gain more strength and the presidency after existing for just 2 years
    - Fillmore just for Maryland
        - Basically the end of the Know-Nothings
    - Example of: Political parties re-aligning along sectional divisions

## The Emergence of Lincoln

## Homework Question - 11/29: John Brown

I think John Brown was a murder.
I belive that Johm Brown belived in the "right" (as in modern) ideas about slavery (that it was bad, racial equality, etc).
However, I think the way in which he expressed his beliefs was wrong.
I can understand his need of violence, as he was both retaliating against the violence done by those who burned Lawrence and using it to resist pro-slavery groups,
but I think violence, especially out of revenge is wrong and not fit for a martyr, symbol, icon.

## Class Notes - 11/30

    - Trolly problem: pull the lever to kill 1 instead of 5

## Homework - 11/30: The Road to Civil War - Simulation

## Stephen Douglas - Kansas-Nebraska Act

### 1 - Introduction

Hi, I am Stephen Arnold Douglas.
I was born in Brandon, Vermont, on April 23, 1813.
My father who served several terms in the Vermont House of Representatives died when I was just two months old.
An important moment in my early life was when I helped arrange the first-ever state Democratic convention in 1835,
and the next year I won election to the Illinois House of Representatives, defeating Whig Party candidate John Hardin.

### 2 - Kansas-Nebraska Act

The Kansas-Nebraska Act, drafted by me, *is peaceful settlement of national issues* and would open the west for expansion and devolpement.
It would create two new western territories, Kansas and Nebraska where the status of slavery determined by popular sovereignty.
This would mean a repeal of the Missouri Compromise which would prohibit slavery in the new territories.

### 3 - Other Crises

#### Compromise of 1850, with its Fugitive Slave Law

Compromise of 1850, with its Fugitive Slave Law, called for the admission of California as a "free state," provided for a territorial government for Utah and New Mexico, established a boundary between Texas and the United States, called for the abolition of slave trade in Washington, DC, and amended the Fugitive Slave Act.
I think it is good because it will help avoid sectional conflicts and settle the slavery issue

#### Dred Scott Decision

The Dred Scott Decision held that the United States Constitution was not meant to include American citizenship for people of black African descent, regardless of whether they were enslaved or free, and so the rights and privileges that the Constitution confers upon American citizens could not apply to them.
I belive that this decision is wrong because I think that Congress has no ability to regulate slavery in the territories. 

#### John Brown's Raid

John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry was an effort by abolitionist John Brown to initiate a slave revolt in Southern states by taking over the United States arsenal at Harpers Ferry, Virginia.
I think that this is bad because it defeats the purpose and ideas of popular sovereignty.
Also this does not help sectional conflicts, instead making both sides more extreme.

### 4 - The Plan Forward

I think the Missouri Compromise should be repealed because it is unfair to the people of the territories.
I think that the Kansas-Nebraska Act is a good compromise and a replacement for the Missouri Compromise
because it will allow the people to decide for themselves.
It will also relieve sectional tensions and allow for the expansion of the country.

### 5 - Other Leaders

#### Jefferson Davis

Jefferson Davis was the US Secretary of War under President Pierre is a US Senator from Mississippi.
(Big South guy, pro-slavery, helped in the Mexican-American War.)

#### Abraham Lincoln

Abraham Lincoln was a self-taught lawyer who served as an Illinois congress member.
In my debates with him (Lincoln-Douglas Debates), he emphasized human equality and economic opportunity for all.
He believed that the nation could not long survive as half slave and half free.

#### William Seward

William Seward was an opponent of the spread of slavery and a US Senator from New York.
He believed that slavery was condemned by a higher law.

### 6 - Talking Points

Note: Mr. vs Ms. depends on the person.
Mr. is used for all of them because that it what was used in the examples.

#### Black New York Abolitionist

Mr. Black New York Abolitionist, I know that you want slavery abolished in the South and prevented from spreading to the West.
However, I think popular sovereignty is the best way to do this.
It could allow for a peaceful transition from slavery to abolition if that is what the people want.

#### Pennsylvania textile manufacturer

Pennsylvania textile manufacturer, I know the Southern cotton is important to your buissness,
and popular sovereignty will likely not interfere cotton production.
However, it will promote the people's right to choose in the new territories
and because people will choose what is best for them, it will lead to further economic development.

#### South Carolina plantation owner

Mr. South Carolina plantation owner, I know slaves are important to your economic well being,
and because of popular sovereignty if most of the people in the South support slavery,
then it should be allowed there.

#### Maryland slaveholder/Union supporter

Mr. Maryland slaveholder/Union supporter, my policies involving popular sovereignty will ease sectional tensions,
and finally solve the slavery question within the US, guaranteeing the Union's survival.
(*This is not really true, see 'bleeding Kansas'*)

#### Indiana ‘Free Soil Party’ member

Mr. Indiana ‘Free Soil Party’ member, I understand that you oppose the expansion of slavery into the western territories,
but I believe that popular sovereignty will better represent the will of the people and avoid conflicts.
The people in those areas should decide what is best for them, not the people elsewhere.

#### Recent Irish Immigrant

Mr. Recent Irish Immigrant, I know that you are concerned both about about slaves taking jobs
and northern manufacturers' reliance on southern slave produced cotton.
Popular sovereignty will allow people to decide what is best for them,
meaning slavery in the South would likely continue and slavery would remain out of northern factories.

## Homework - 12/3: The Road to Civil War - Simulation Reflection

### "My favorite moment of the simulation was when..."

I think the "mill around time" was the most fun.
It was unstructured and allowed for more discussion rather than specific answers and questions.

### "I felt I was at my best when..."

I felt like I did a good job of answering the questions.
However, I noticed that many people did not really notice that I was lying a bit.
(Example: "Popular sovereignty will avoid all bloodshed and sectional conflicts" - but there was the Bleeding Kansas)

### "I want to give a special shout out to... because..."

I think all the people asking questions did a good job of trying to find a flaw in the arguments and turning it into a question.
They made me think and try to word my arguments in a way that hid the flaws.

## Class Notes - 12/6: Emancipation Proclamation

- Could be used to aid the war effort
    - Free the black people forced to do labor for the Confederacy
- Lincoln | Constitution protects property and at this time slavery = property (so as president he can not free the slaves)
    - | As commander in chief, he could convince people Emancipation was part of the war effort
- Proclaimation: 100 days to rejoin the Union, or we will free your slave labors
    - A lot of blowback
        - Lost seats in Congress
        - The North feared that the South would never meet this compromise
            - Meaning the war would go on forever
    - Changed the meaning of the war
        - Some people fought just for the preservation of the Union
            - Now, the focus is on the slavery
            - Might lose support from the border states
                - Some slave states did not concede from the Union

## Homework Questions - 12/5: Gettysburg Address

1. What makes the Gettysburg Address, which is so brief, so “monumental,” as Senator Sumner described it?

Lincoln represented the Civil War as a test that would determine whether a nation could endure.
He also honors the sacrifices of those who died in the Civil War in defense of the United States' principles of liberty and equality.

2. What does Lincoln mean when he says “we cannot hallow this ground”?
What does it mean to “hallow”?
And why, according to Lincoln, can’t we do this?
What, according to him, must we do instead?

Hallow means to honor as holy.
Lincoln argues that we can not hallow the ground because it is already made sacred by the men who fought there.
Instead, the people must work to finish what the men fought for (make the country better) so the men did not die in vain.

3. You have been tasked by the Gettysburg gift shop to print and sell t-shirts at the next anniversary of the Gettysburg Address.
However, they are requiring that you choose only one quote, no more than one sentence, from Lincoln’s speech to print on the shirt.
Which one would you choose and why?

> It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced.

I think the quote is quite poetic.
Also the quote is the main "call to action" of the speech, meaning it would be good to put on a shirt so others can see the message.

# Chapter 16 - America's Gilded Age

## Homework Questions - 1/8

### Step 2

In the mid-to-late 1800's, many inventions and innovations revolutionized the United States and, subsequently, the world.
Which invention or innovation mentioned in this section of Chapter 16 (or that you are aware of that's not mentioned in this section)
would you want to be in on the ground floor, so to speak, because of its importance?

I think the light bulb is one of the most important inventions of the time because allowed people to work and live in the dark.
Its importance is still felt today, as it is still used in almost every house and buisness.

### Step 3

Find an article or report on a new or emerging invention or technology that has the potential to change the world.
Then write 3-5 sentences summarizing the invention and the potential impact it can have, both positive and negative.

Sand batteries could solve one of green energy's biggest challenges:
the challenge to provide a year-round, steady power supply from renewable energy during changing seasons and variable weather conditions.
This is especially important for countries like Finland, that have long summer days, and cold winters (must store power for months at a time).
They work by storing heat in sand, which is a very effective medium for retaining heat over a long period.
They can be build with low quality sand (sand rejected for other uses like construction) and are very low maintenance.

## Homework Question - 1/11: Individual liberty and the economy

*How did social reformers such as Edward Ballamy, Henry George, and advocates of the Social Gospel movement conceive of liberty and freedom differently than the proponents of the liberty of laissez-faire economics and the free market?*

Edward Bellamy, Henry George, and advocates of the Social Gospel movement overall thought that liberty
could not fully exist without a more equal distribution of wealth and opportunities.
They believed that the laissez-faire economic system, with a large focus on individual self-interest and limited government interference,
led to social and economic inequality that restricted the ability of many people to exercise their freedom and liberties
(meaning they weren't fully free).

On the other hand, proponents of laissez-faire economics and the free market placed a greater emphasis on individual freedom and liberty, and argued that government interference in economic affairs tends to hinders these values instead of promoting them.
They believe that the free market, by allowing individuals to make their own economic decisions and pursue their own self-interest, promotes greater liberty and prosperity for all.

Social reformers and advocates of the Social Gospel movement saw freedom as including both individual liberty and the collective good, while proponents of laissez-faire economics and the free market tended to focus more on individual liberty and the right to private property.

## Homework Question - 1/12: "Centuries of Dishonor: The So-Called 'Indian Wars'"

1. What was the Sand Creek massacre, and in what ways was it representative of the Indian Wars of the late 1800’s?
In what ways was it representative of native American history more generally since European discovery and colonization?

Led by Colonel John Chivington, 700 soldiers (minus 2 companies) attacked and killed many inhabitants, unprovoked, a settlement of Native Americans who believed they were under protection of the US government.
Like most conflicts between native Americans and settlers, the native Americans were on the losing side, and it resulted in the deaths of many of them. However, while it was intially celebrated, there was significant backlash/consquences of these actions.
It is representative of native American history more gennerally as it was a violent and bloody conflict, as a (indirect) result of expansionism and greed while at the same time further strengthening/enforcing the circle of violence and conflict between settlers and native Americans.

2. As noted above and in your reading, there were people on both sides who tried to do the right thing,
but the forces of expansionism, survival, greed and prejudice all contributed to many heinous acts, especially against native Americans.
What would you have done to address these problems?

It is really easy to look back and say something like the Americans should have just respected the native Americans and let them keep their lands (or even something like they should have just not expanded West into their lands). However then you get results like the Proclamation of 1763 and I think it would have been very hard to try to stop the westward expansion. The main issue was the two groups of people wanted the land exclusivly for themselves, leading to the violent conflicts, but one group had superior force.

3. It has been suggested that the U.S. should pay reparations to native Americans for centuries of human rights violations and land seizures.
Would you agree? Why or why not? How would you determine the value and kind of such reparations?

I don't fully understand the situtation of native Americans today, so I am not sure how money would/could improve or change their condition. If it would help them (I can't imagine it hurting), I think it makes sense. I have no idea how the value would be calculated, but I coulld see it being tied to the value of land lost/taken by the US government. At worst it would be like the US paying Mexico after the Mexican-American War, but I think it would show the ackwelegment of the native Americans, what happened to them, what is happening to them, as well as make ammends for not fully ackolwegeing them in the past.

# Chapter 17 - Freedom's Boundaries, at Home and Abroad

## Homework Questions - 1/17: The Wizard of Oz as a Populist Tale

1. What are the main arguments given for interpreting The Wizard of Oz as a Populist tale?

One of the arguments given for interpreting "The Wizard of Oz" as a Populist tale is that the story represents the political and economic struggles America at that time/during the Populist movement.
The characters in the story, such as the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Cowardly Lion, are interpreted as representing different groups in society,
such as western farmers, industrial workers, and politicians (William Jennings Bryan, Populist presidential candidate in 1896), respectively.
Additionally, the Wizard is seen as a representation of any of the Gilded Age presidents, 
the wicked Witch of the East as eastern industrialists and bankers who controlled the people (the Munchkins)
the yellow brick road (and its dangers) as the gold standard,
Dorothy's silver slippers as the Populists' solution to the nation's economic woes
and the Emerald City as Washington, D.C.

2. What are the main arguments against this interpretation?

One of the main arguments against this interpretation is that Baum was not a Populist, but rather a Republican 
(so it would not make sense for him to write a story that was critical of the Republican party and supporting an opposing movement).

3. So what do you think? Did L. Frank Baum intend for The Wizard of Oz to be a Populist tale?

I don't think Baum intended for "The Wizard of Oz" to be a Populist tale.
A lot of the arguments for it being a Populist tale seem a little stretched to me, but I don't think it is a coincidence that the story has a lot of similarities to America at that time.

## Class Notes - 1/17: Rise of the Populist Party

- 1867-1896
- Populist: historically (even before this time period) the people's party
    - Word of the people

### Farmers’ Problems

- Crop prices fell steadily in the late 19th century
    - More efficient transportation: cheaper to ship goods
    - More transportation: more available goods
    - Farming becomes more efficient (new tech, new strategies): more total crops
- Farmers had difficulty paying back high interest loans
    - Crop price fall &rarr; farmer doesn't have enough money &rarr; needs a spring time loan for seeds/workers/etc &rarr; high interest loan &rarr; can't pay back &rarr; lose house/etc
- Railroad companies charged high rates to transport goods
    - Farmers dependent on whatever train company controlled the nearby railroad (local monopoly)

### Farmers’ Organizations

- The Grange was a network of local organizations founded to address farmers’ issues in 1867
- In the 1870s, the Grange was successful in promoting state laws to regulate railroad rates
    - Wanted to elect members (who would help/support/etc the farmers) to legislature to pass laws to regulate railroad rates
    - But were struck down by the USSC
        - Can't regulate prices
- Helped lead to the Farmers’ Alliance(s)
    - Became powerful in the 1880s and elected governors, congressmen, and senators

### Populist Party

- The successes of the Alliances led to a new political party in 1890s: the People’s Party (the Populists)
- Party platform
    - Expanding supply of money by coining silver which would reduce farmers’ debt
        - Very low amount of global gold (especially compared to silver)
        - It would lead to inflation
            - Usually inflation is bad, but in helps people (farmers) to pay back loans
            - Hurts people without loans and espically the middle class (who have savings)
    - Gov ownership of railroads to control shipping rates
    - Implementation of a progressive income tax
        - Tax the rich more
            - Flat tax:
                - 10% of 1 million > 10% of 100
            - Progressive tax:
                - 20% of 1 million > 10% of 100

### 1892 Presidential Election

- As a third party, the populists did fairly good
- However, the US election system really only works for the best two candidates (which the populists weren't)
- Were successful in local elections

### 1896 Election

- Democratic candidate William Jennings Bryan
    - Populists understood they could not win the election
    - So they supported the closest candidate to them (Bryan)
- Republican candidate William McKinley
    - Wins the election
- However, lots of populists ideas were implemented

### Modern Populism

- Sanders and Trump have opposite policies but had large support bases
    - Had opposite solutions, but diagnosed the same problems
        - There are elites in American society who are oppressing the everyday people
- Bernie Sanders: buisness elite + large institutions/corporations = the problem
- Donald Trump: government elite + liberal/left-wing elites = the problem
- Populism election plan: appeal to the most people &rarr; get more votes
    - Even if polices are no populist, they still want the votes of everyone

## The Segregated South

### The Redeemers in Power

- Failure of populism in the South &rarr; new racial order
- Redeemers: merchants, planters, buisnes entrepreneurs (white elites)
    - Wanted to undo the gains of Reconstruction
        - Main target public education (created gap between next generation of whites/blacks)
        - Made it easier to arrest people (for minor crimes, harsher punishments)
            - States could rent out prisoners to private companies
            - Cheap labor, bad conditions, many died

### The Failure of the New South Dream

- 1880s: Atlanta editor Henry Grady promoted idea of **New South**
    - Industrial expansion
- Instead. the top became richer while the rest became poorer
- Some improvements
    - Upcountry cotton factories for poor whites
        - Jobs for whole family
        - But abused the low wages and low taxes in the South
- Other than Birmingham (Alabama), no major industrial cities
    - Birmingham: steel, iron
    - Rest: cotton, tobacco, rice, etc
        - Little industry or skilled labor
        - Dependent on the North

## Class Notes - 1/19: Post-Reconstruction South/Lynching

- Racial heirarchy
    - One race is superior to another
- Once the Reconstruction ends, the majority of whites in the South worked to rebuild the racial heirarchy
    - Added barriers to voting
        - Targeted against blacks
        - Had to pass tests to vote
            - Scored by a white person
        - Grandfather clause: don't have to get the test if your grandfather could vote
            - Only whites people had this (pre-civil war)
        - Poll tax/literacry test
        - 1940: 3-4% of black adults could vote
            - No representation
    - Jim Crow/"seperate but equal"
        - Segragation
        - Not actually equal
            - Less resources, materials, funding, etc
        - 7-1 passed in Supreme Court
            - Likely knew the effects, but still harbored racist ideas
                - Only 1 generation from slavery
    - Racial terror
        - "Terror": instill fear, politically motivated
        - "Upity": blacks trying to go against the racial heirachy
            - Target for racial terror
        - Lynching
            - Extra judicial killing of an individual by a mob
                - Out side of the actual legal system
            - Common in the South, against African Americans
                - Or "sympathizers"
        - Pogroms
            - Organized violence against a minority group
            - Backed/supported by the government
            - Goal: fear them enough to leave
- Share cropping
    - Replaced slavery
        - Basically slavery (no rights, basically no pay)

### Lynching

- Lynchings were public/celebrated crimes
    - Send a message
        - Instill fear
        - If try to upset the racial heirachy -> publically murdered
    - The lynchings were advertised in the news
        - People would come to watch
            - Childern too
            - Viewed like a spectacle/event
        - Spread the message to all
- Killed acused blacks before trial
    - Often acused of harassing white women or murder
    - Usually false/no evidence acusations
- Not just adult men were lynched
    - If they could not find the man, they would lynch his wife/children/family
- Lynching reinforced the evolution of slavery
    - Lasting effects
        - Unequal judicary represenation


## Homework Question - 1/23: American Interventionism

3. Would you have voted to go to war with Spain in consideration of President McKinley’s reasons, what else you know about the historical context, and your criteria for when intervention is justified?
Why or why not?

President McKinley’s Declaration of War gives many reasons supporting the war, including many that would still fit "modern" ideals.
To me, the first and second reasons "sound the best" (fit in with the ideals the best) as they argue for intervention to help Cuba and the people in Cuba, rather than promote the US. 
President McKinley also argues that intervention will help the US, both by helping protect its citizens (4) but also economically (3).
In addition, he uses the recent destruction of a US battleship as an example of the danger of letting the situation continue without US intervention.
However, I despite the reasons listed, the textbooks implies that the US was more interested in the economic and nationalistic benefits of the war than the humanitarian reasons.
After the war, the US did not do a good job of helping the people of the lands they "conquered" or sticking to their ideals of freedom/equality,
instead becoming more like the European powers they orginally rebelled against.

# Chapter 18 - The Progressive Era

## Homework Questions - 1/26: The Bishop's School History

1. Briefly describe the circumstances surrounding Bishop's founding and why it was founded.

Bishop's was founded as a college preparatory school for girls.
Its founders saw an oppertunity to make a lasting contribution to eduation and provide a learning environment that would help students develop academically, socially, physically, and spiritually.
In addition, its founders believed that education led not only to a career, but also to a life of public service in the Christian tradition.

2. What part of the Bishop's story did you find most interesting, intriguing, surprising or scandalous and why?

I thought it was intresting that the religious motives for creating Bishop's were very strong.
While we have a chapel on campus, there is little relgious influence at the school.
Even the chapel meetings are more focused on general ideas or personal lessons, rather than religious teachings.

# Chapter 19 - Safe for Democracy: The United States and World War I

## Homework Questions - 2/6: Russia/Ukraine Reflection

The main problem (that I see) is that the US can not not get involved in the conflict.
While the point of this reflection is to compare the current situation to WWI, I think there are many similairites with WWII.
Everone knows that appeasement did not work in WWII and I see litte reason to believe that it will work in this situation.
However, if the US gets involved, the scope of the war will only increase leading to more deaths and destruction.
But the US has some stake in the result of the war (natural resources, lasting dislike of Russia, etc).
I am not sure what I would advise the US to do, but I think that the precedent should be set that war is bad and should be avoided for all parties.

## Homework Questions - 2/8: Woodrow Wilson

1. Why, according to this article, is Woodrow Wilson's legacy being reconsidered? What specifically from this article and your textbook have you learned about Wilson that could be considered problematic?

While Wilson is mostly known for his actions during WWI, his 14 points, and for trying to start the League of Nations, his legacy is being reconsidered because of his racist views and actions.
He supported segragation and the Ku Klux Klan.
Also while he was president of Princeton, he did not allow any black students to attend the school.

2. If you were an administrator at Princeton University, would you vote to remove Wilson's name from buildings and other spaces? Why or why not?

I agree most with Ms. Tanjong from the article.
There is a difference between being worshipped and having your name on a building.
Despite his racist ideas, Wilson did many good things for the school such as expanding it into a full-scale university, lifting educational standards, creating academic majors, and introducing the small-group classes.
I would not remove his name from the buildings, but I would spend more effort on educating students about Wilson rather than just the good parts of his legacy.

## Class Notes - 2/6: Eugenics

- Natural selection
    - Survival of the fittest
    - Pressure from the environment
- Artifical selection
    - Pressure from humans
    - Selecting for certain traits
        - Ex: dogs
        - Ex: plants
            - Humans have been doing this for thousands of years with farming
- Eugenics:
    - The practice or advocacy of controlled selective breeding of humans populations (as by sterilization) to improve the populations genetic composition
    - Positive eugenics
        - Selecting for certain traits (ex: encouraging people with "good genes" to have more children)
    - Negative eugenics
        - Selecting against certain traits (ex: sterilizing people with "bad genes")
        - "Snuff them out"
            - Nazi Germany
- Social Darwinism
    - The idea that human societies/institutions/people are subject to the same laws of natural selection as biological organisms
    - Not a leap from Darwin's theory of evolution for plants and animals
        - Humans are just another species
    - Against the welfare/helping the lower part of the population of 19th/20th century progressive era
        - Interfering with natural selection so now the "weak" are surviving and propgating genes instead of dying off
- Potential "undesirable" characteristics:
    - Criminality
    - "Feeblemindedness"
    - Physical or mental deformities
    - Nationality
    - "Race"
    - Having kids with any of the traits
- Eugenics was popular for educated individuals
    - Supreme Court progressive chief justice Holmes supported it
- In part to stop/check immigrants
    - Americans worried that they would be outnumbered/overtaken
    - Would destroy the American gene pool, American ideals/values would be lost
- Sterilzed without their consent

## Homework Question - 2/10: Flappers

How did flappers challenge the preconcieved notions about the "proper" role, behavior, and appearence of women in society?

Flappers challenged the traditional "Victorian" ideas of gender roles.
They worked outside the home and were much more active.
They drove cars, smoked, drank (which was illegal at the time), and danced in new ways, all of which were outside of the view of how a women should act.
In may ways, they tried to remain childlike in their ideas about truth, risk, and recklessness.
They also dressed differently and treated sex in a casual manner.
While all people did not see them this way, flappers could be seen as the next step in the feminist movement and as a progressition of the freedom the suffragettes fought for.

## Homework Question - 2/13: 621-635 and Response

What specific parallels do you see between the "culture wars" and concerns related to tolerance and immigration in the 1910s and 1920s and similar issues in the 2010s and 2020s?

A reoccuring political theme is controversy over change.
For example the conflict between the fundamentalists and the modernists/progressives over ideas in science such as Darwin's Theory of Evolution.
Another reoccuring problem (for America) is immigration.
Compared to the founding of European countries, America is a relatively new country and is mostly made of people whose ancestors immigrated to the country.
However, the US has a history of being xenophobic and racist, such as the Chinese Exclusion Act, immigration quotas, or the Ku Klux Klan.
Fears over immigration are still common in the US, with a large part of Donald Trump's campagin focused on building a wall between the US and Mexico.

### CHAT GTP

The culture wars and concerns related to tolerance and immigration in both the 1910s and 1920s and the 2010s and 2020s share several parallels:
1. Tension between traditional and progressive values: In both eras, there was a tension between traditional and progressive values regarding cultural norms, social practices, and beliefs. This led to conflicts and debates over issues such as women's rights, LGBTQ rights, religious freedoms, and immigration policies.
2. Controversial immigration policies: Both the 1910s and 1920s and the 2010s and 2020s saw controversy over immigration policies, with debates over border security, illegal immigration, and the treatment of immigrants.
3. Xenophobia and racism: In both eras, xenophobia and racism have played a role in shaping public opinion and political discourse around immigration and cultural issues. There have been instances of anti-immigrant sentiment and efforts to restrict immigration based on race or ethnicity.
4. Political polarization: Political polarization has been a hallmark of both the 1910s and 1920s and the 2010s and 2020s, with people becoming increasingly entrenched in their beliefs and political affiliations. This has led to a further divide on cultural and immigration issues, making it difficult to find common ground and reach a consensus.

Overall, the similarities between the two eras suggest that cultural and immigration concerns are ongoing and persistent in American society and that the challenges faced in both eras are still relevant today.

## Homework Question - 2/15: "Fireside Chat"

What does Roosevelt mean by the difference between the definition of liberty that has existed in the past and his own "broader definition of liberty"?
How do feel about these definitions and how they may apply in the 21st century?

Roosevelt is an example of the changing definition of "liberalism."
Before, liberalism was associated with limited/small governement and laissez-faire capitalism/the free market (absence of government interference).
However, Roosevelt's definition of liberalism is much closer to the modern definition, instead meaning a government that is active in the economy and society.
The government should play a role in ensuring the economic well-being of all its citizens.
I think it is important that there is a balance, that the government is not "all powerful."
For example, I think the government should promote education, healthcare, and employment, but maintain the American values like freedom of speech and privacy.

## Homework Questions - 2/21: Four Freedoms

### A

Briefly analyze one of the "Four Freedoms" paintings.
How is this particular freedom being depicted?
What are some of the central elements of the painting that convey or represent this freedom?
What does this depiction say about America or American values at this time?

Freedom from Want:
These paintings were created during/after the Great Depression.
This painting in particular shows a large family sitting down to eat a nice meal.
This would indicate that they are well off, that they have enough food to eat, and their basic needs are meet.
This reflects the shift in American values from negative to positive liberty, as the family has the freedom to eat without worrying about where their next meal will come from.

### B

![Freedom of Thought](https://sebastianhetman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Standard-16.jpg)

Freedom of Thought:
While it would seem obvious that we have freedom of thought, espically if we have freedom of speech, but that is not always the case.
This is the most evident with the rise of social media.
Social media "feeds" (instresting word...) are designed and shaped by and for our time and engagement.
Yet despite this, we still engage with social media "willingly."
I think that this picture illustrates the idea that we may not know were are thoughts or ideas come from, or that they come from an external source.

## Class Notes - 2/21: Atomic Bomb

- The atomic bomb ushered in the atomic age
    - Atomic age 1940s-1980/present
- Nuclear power is more eco friendly than fossil fuels
    - Almost limitless energy
        - Smaller amount of the same fuel can produce more energy than fossil fuels
        - Example of humanity's growing access to energy
            - From human muscle power to wood to fossil fuels to nuclear power
            - More stuff, less work
- Nuclear weapons
    - Everyone including US has many atomic weapons

### How it works

- `E = mc^2`
    - Energy = mass * speed of light ^ 2
    - `c^2` = a lot of energy
        - A lot of energy is released when mass is converted to energy
    - Einstein - mass and energy are 2 different forms of the same thing
        - Went against Newton's laws
- Chemical energy vs nuclear energy
    - Chemical energy
        - Energy stored in the bonds of atoms
            - (Or position of electrons)
        - Can be released by breaking/changing the bonds
            - Burning fossil fuels
    - Nuclear energy
        - Energy stored in the nucleus of an atom
        - Can be released by splitting or fusing atoms
            - Releases a lot more energy than chemical energy
- Splitting an atom
    - Neutron: neutral particle
    - Get a big a unstable atom isotope (ex: Uranim 235/92)
        - Isotope: atom with a different number of neutrons
        - Hit the atom with a neutron
            - Breaks the atom into 2 smaller atoms
            - Releases 3 extra neutrons
                - These 3 neutrons can hit other atoms and split them
                    - Creates a chain reaction
                        - Only need a starter
                    - Releases a lot of energy
        - Happens naturally
            - Carbon dating
    - Immediately after learning about the chain reaction, they realized they could make a bomb
- Fusion reaction
    - Nuclear fission: splitting atoms to release energy from the nucleus
    - Nuclear fusion: directly transforms mass into energy
        - A little bit of mass from 2 atoms is converted into a lot of energy, helium, and a neutron
        - The (sun = star) is a giant fusion reaction
            - Heat and pressure from the gravity field of the sun compresses hydrogen atoms to form helium
            - Releases a lot of energy
- Fusion bomb
    - Tsar Bomb
        - 50 megatons of TNT
        - 3,000 times more powerful than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima
- The Manhattan Project
    - Code name for the secret project to build an atomic bomb in the US
    - Massive decentralized project headquartered in Los Alamos, new Mexico
        - If it goes wrong, not all eggs in the same basket
        - More groups working on the same problem, more creative solutions
    - Only possible due to the industrial might and relative safety of the US homeland
        - Expensive, etc
        - Wouldn't hurt the war effort, US could spare industrial resources
        - Also wouldn't get blown up
    - Key players: Leo Szilard, Albert Einstein, Enrico Fermi, Robert Oppenhiemer
        - US (as an immigrant country) accepted a lot of immigrant scientists
        - 3 of the 4 fleeing facism, 4th is a child of immigrants
            - Many were Jewish
                - (In Germany, nuclear physics was seen as a "Jewish field")
    - Successful test at Trinity, New Mexico (July 16, 1945)
    - Letter from Einstein to FDR
        - Urged FDR to build an atomic bomb before the Germans
        - Einstein regretted building the bomb once he saw the effects and realized Germany could not make one
- Only 5 countries trying to make atomic weapons
    - US, UK, USSR, Germany, Japan
    - Only US succeeded in WWII
        - Used to defeat Japan, Germany was already defeated before the success of the Manhattan Project

### Hiroshima and Nagasaki (August 6 and 9, 1945)

- A list of possible targets was created
    - Targets were chosen based on military value, population, and industrial value
    - But also weather and personal opinions
        - Ex: don't bomb X because it was nice when I vacationed there
        - Ex: don't bomb Y because it is already destroyed so we can't get a full test of the damage
- Bombs were relativly small and air exploded
    - Can go Japan RN (not too bad nuclear radiation)
- Hiroshima
    - Bombed first
        - Total war: all targets are fair game
        - Hoped to get Japan to surrender
    - 90k-140k dead
    - 1 bomb - Little Boy
    - 15 kilotons TNT
- Nagasaki
    - Bombed second
        - Japan did not surrender after Hiroshima
    - 39k-80k dead
    - 1 bomb - Fat Man
    - 21 kilotons of TNT

### Modern day

- Electricity from nuclear power
    - Potential for "clean" power, but very high risk
- High deaths from nuclear power (happen all at once, meltdown, etc)
    - But a lot less than coal plants
