### Indians of Eastern North America

- Hundreds of tribes between Gulf of Mexico and Canada
    - Lived on squash, corn, beans, and hunted/fished
- Until 5th century, there was no central authority
    - Warred frequently
- Leagues/confederations emerged to unite local areas
    - Southeast: Choctaw, Cherokee, Chicksaw
    - Northeast: 5 Iroquois formed a **Great League of Peace**
        - Mohawk, Oneida, Cayuga, Seneca, Onondaga
- Each group was very different
    - Different politics, religions, languages
    - Identified locally (not countries, etc)

### Native American Religion

- Groups were similair in some ways
    - Focus on relgions, often in relation to hunting/farming
    - Spritual power/spirits infused in everything
        - Wanted the aid of the spirits
    - Religous rites and religious authority structure

### Land and Property

- Village leaders asssigned land to families
    - Families had a right to use the land, but did not own it (not real estate)
- Tribes claimed land for hunting
    - Unclaimed land could be used by anyone
- Sometimes moved often for new/better land
    - Didn't collect wealth/material goods
- Social status mattered, but reputation came from willingness to share goods
    - Trade was more than commerical (generosity was most valued)

    - "Noble savages": gentle, friendly, superior in some ways
    - Uncivilized barbarians
- Negative veiws later overshadowed positive ones
- Barbaric on 3 areas:
    1. Religion - not genuine relgion or the devil
    2. Land use - land was a commodity, not a world of spirits
        - Spanish claimed land by right of conquest and papal authority
        - English/French/Dutch claimed land by saying the natives did not actually "use" the land
    3. Gender relations - weak men and mistreated women

    - Did not live under government or fixed laws
    - Did not use European definitions of authority

    - Freedom to follow spirtual values
    - Well-being and security of the community

### Christian Liberty

- Early European societies were hierarchical
    - Men > women and children
        - "Coverture": when a women married, she lost legal identity to husband
        - King over subjects = husband over family
            - Both "ordained" by God

### Liberty and Liberties

- Liberty came from fullfilling the duties appropriate to one's rank
- Most men lacked the freedom of economic independence
    - Largely controlled and dominated by upper classes
- Remenats of Middle Age "liberties"
    - Formal specific privilages: self-government, no taxes, right to practice a specific trade
    - Granted by contract, royal decree, or purchase
    - No criticism of authority

## Homework Question - 8/22

How can scienctific analysis help us understand history?
Please draw examples from the article and any other examples which come to mind.

Scienctific analysis can help us understand history by uncovering new previously unknown information.
For example, in one part of the article talks about the split between the Andes' lowland and highland people about 8,750 years ago.
Without scienctific analysis we would not have the ability to track the split and the differences of DNA between the highland and lowland people.
This would make it impossible to estimate the the amount of lives lost due to European contact, which is an import part of history.
Scienctific analysis also can help us look much further into the past.
For example it can provide insight on things like the end of the dinosaurs or the formation of universe.

## Homework Questions - 8/24

1. According to this article, what are some of the reasons why Columbus might be considered a hero? A villain?

| Hero | Villain |
| :- | :- |
| - United the people of the world (trade of ideas, goods, etc) | - Brought slavery with him (and disease) |
| - Started the process of the creation of the US (and the good that came from it) | - Partially responsable for the things that came after him |

2. Dr. Fernández-Armesto lists several principles that should control our evaluation of historical people and events.
Which of these is the most interesting, intriguing or significant to you?
Do you disagree with any or would you add any?

I think the idea that contextalization is important is important, especally when looking at good and evil.
It would be unfair to say Columbus was a villain because he believed in slavery.
In the US, 4 of the first 5 presidents owned slaves, but they were still good people that helped many people.

3. What does the author mean when he says for some “moral indignation with Columbus is too precious to discard” and for others “kinship with a culture hero is too profound a part of America’s sense of identity to be easily excised”?
Being transparent about our own biases, which of these categories do you feel you are more likely to fall into?

The author means that people want to believe a partial version of a truth that fits their view of the world.
I think I fall somewhere inbetween.
I would be slightly biased towards "Columbus the villain" because I think it's easier to see the negative consquences than the benefits.
(Killing 1 person carries more weight than saving 1 person.)

4. So was Columbus a hero or a villain? Related to this, should we or should we not commemorate Columbus Day?

Life does not work in black and white.
He should not be be seen as a hero or a villain, but somewhere inbetween.
I think we should not celebrate "Columbus Day" as "Columbus" Day, but something that focuses more about both the new world wide connection and the downsides/consquences. (Celebrated as a day marking the beginning of change.)

## Homework Questions - 8/30

1. According to William Bradford, what was the impetus behind writing the Mayflower Compact?

Some people aboard *The Mayflower* were not completely on the same level of unity as others.
The Mayflower Compact would be an agreement to organize a government that would operate to benefit everyone.

2. What form of government does the Mayflower Compact seek to establish?
Describe this government with reference to specific concepts and terms in the text.

The Mayflower Compact calls the government a "Civil Body Politic".
The government will meet repeatly with the purpse of creating
equal laws, ordiances, acts, constitions, and offices.

3. In what ways might this document be viewed as a “precursor” to the Declaration of
Independence and the Constitution?
In what ways is it different from these documents?

The government is made from multiple people and it will create equal laws.
A main complaint leading to the Declaration of Independence was unequal taxing
(and without input from the people).
It is different in the way that the people "promise all due submission and obedience".

### Harvard Alma Mater Song

1. Should Harvard change the lyrics to its Alma Mater Song?

Yes.
I think that it should be updated to match the current ideas of inclusion.
It is different than changing the words of a textbook or document.
It is not hiding the past.
The song serves a different purpose, it is supposed to be a welcoming song,
not a historical document.

2. Why is it important whether or not Harvard made the change?

It does sort of change history.
All the new students will hear the new version and have a different idea of what Harvard
is compared to those before.
It further detaches Harvard from its past.

3. How does this discussion relate to other questions of historical legacy and memory in America?

People will forget about this change, and the updated song will sort of overwrite the original in history.

## Origins of American Slavery

- Need for workers
    - Indentured servants weren't cutting it &rarr; slave trade

    - Knew what they were doing
    - Already exposed to European diseases
    - Slavers forever
        - Children would be slaves
    - Did not have basic Englishman's rights
    - Hard time escaping
        - Visually different
        - Did not know the land

### Englishmen and Africans

- English did not like foreigners
    - Africans, Irish, Native Americans
    - Savage
- Race/Racism not fully devolped at this time
    - But similar ideas of "us" and "them" were present

### Slavery in History

- Was always a thing
    - Prisoners of war, etc
- In Americas, slavery was based around the plantation
    - Economic/agricultural enterprise
    - Hard demanding labor
    - High death rates
    - Became associated with race/skin color

### Slavery in the West Indies

    - Expensive compared to indentured servants (they often died before they could get their worth)

### Slavery and the Law

- Spain's laws were transfered to its American colonies
    - Often ignored, but slaves had some rights
- English laws became much worse
    - In some places, there wasn't a clear line between black and slave
        - However, it was far from equal

### The Rise of Chesapeake Slavery

- Officals wanted to improve status of all white people to make it more appealing to migrate there
    - As a result, it got worse for blacks
        - You were either white or other (no inbetween)
- 1662: Virginia law where child takes mother's status
    - Better for abusing slaves so the kids would also be slaves

## Homework Questions - 8/31

1. What is the Flushing Remonstrance?
Who drafted it, why, and what is its basic message?

Settlers drafted it in 1657 in Flushing.
They wanted to petition the Dutch colonial government uphold freedom of conscience and permit religious pluralism.

2. Why do you think Governor Stuyvesant rejected the Remonstrance?
Are there any understandable or justifiable reasons for him to deny religious or ideological diversity in this new colony?

He rejected it because he would only tolerate his Dutch Reformed Church (and the Remonstrance went against that idea).

3. What has been the legacy of the Remonstrance?

It was the first document in America to argue for religious freedom.
Also the people did not just argue/petition to solve their own problems, they argued for everyone's right to choose.
It lead to Queens being one of the most divese country in the US.
However, there is no proof that later advocators for rights
(like those who wrote the Bill of Rights, Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, or the Declaration of Independence)
were influenced by the Remonstrance.

## Class Notes - 9/2

- Constellation of features
    - Group a set of features (skin color, hair, facial structure) into a racial category
- Police boundries
    - Not nessissarly based on ancestry
        - More based on visual features

    - Man made (doesn't make it false)
    - We give value to the assumed "race"
    - Paper money based on the fact that other people think it has value/meaning
- **Essentialization**
    - Ascribing one trait to another trait
    - Renforces/strengthens social construct
        - Leads to stereotypes
    - She is good at math because she is Asian

### Power of an Illusion: Race

- "All men are created equal"
    - Had slaves
- How people assign meaning to how they look
- Notes on the State of Virginia (Thomas Jefferson)
    - Africans might be different from time/circumstance but they are inferior
- Not all are "men"
    - Justified slavery
- In early America: economic status and religion > race/skin color
    - Slow shift
- Replaced indured servants with African slave trades
    - Europeans weren't willing to come to America anymore
    - Became: "black (slaves)" and "white European (masters)"
        - Became more accepted/"natural"

### Inventing Black and White

- Fearful of African + indentured servant force
- Gave lowest "whites" more rights to distinguise them from the African slaves
    - Less likely they would unite again

1. Why was Bacon's Rebellion a turning point for the status and rights of people of African descent in Virginia?
    - Associated them with perpetral slavery
    - Worse rights
    - Now more sperated from the "whites" 
2. What motivated Virginia's lawmakers to make legal distinctions between white and black inhabitants?
What effect did those distinctions have on Virginia's universe of obligation?

    - They were worried about another combined force of Africans and indentured servants (Europeans)
    - Sought to make them seperate so they could not join again
    - Not obligated towards the slaves
    - Yes, they do influence the way people think about who belongs because they are the formal written guide
        - Carries different weight
3. What does Ira Berlin mean hwne he says that freedom and slavery were created at the same moment?
How does creating an "out" group strengthen the identity and status of the "in" group?
    - Your identity is "not the out group" &rarr; desire to be in the in group
4. Not going to type question
    - Rich people could get richer
    - Easy to say:
        - Relative to me, Africans are all slaves, so Africans are meant to slaves
    - The poor whites could now say:
        - I am different that the slaves
        - Part of the group that has rich people

## Homework Questions - 9/3

1. What makes 1619 such a momentous year both for Jamestown and for American history?

In 1619, the first Africans arrived in Virginia.
They came as unwilling slaves who were stolen from their homes.
It marked the start of imported slavery that still has impact today.
Also in that year, the General Assembly (the House of Burgesses)
met for the first time, marking the beginnings of representative
government in the colonies.
(And the first women arrived in Jamestown in 1619.)

2. What, according to this article, makes American slavery unique from its global counterparts?

Slavery was permanent and hereditary.
Childern inherited their parents status so they were enslaved at birth.

3. Knowing what you know now about the history of slavery in America – from the
horrendous cruelty of slavery itself to the horrors of the Civil War to the continued civil
rights abuses and racism it spawned even after its abolition – what would you have done as
a member of Jamestown to try to avert this history from coming to fruition?

I think it would have been hard to change things.
Looking back on it, we now know much more than the people at the time.
Also, the people at that time were looking for profits and did not care about the well being of "other" (as in not their people) people.
I think the best chance for changing the course of history would be
to educate people before the imported slaves arrive that those people are still people.

### The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano, or Gustavus Vassa, The African

1. At the end of the first sentence, the author writes that the slave ship was “waiting for its cargo.”
To what cargo is he referring?

The slaves

2. Describe the conditions on board the boat, specifically those under deck.

Terrible.
Terrible smell, very compact, hot, unsanitary.

3. Why did the narrator get beaten for not eating?

So he would survive (and the owners would not lose money).

## Homework Questions - 9/6

1. What about Benjamin Franklin’s life do you find most interesting or intriguing?

I found the fact that Benjamin created a fire department interesting.
I would not have thought that it was something that was important/needed,
but it was mentioned multiple times in the article.
I think it woul be intresting to learn more about when/how/why he created it.

2. Is there anything about his life that surprised you, perhaps even scandalized you?

I did not know he had a large family.
It surprised me that his family was not super "close".
For example when his brother would not publish his writings
and got mad when he found out how Benjamin had tricked him,
Benjamin left and moved to Philadelphia.

3. Of his many achievements, which do you consider Benjamin Franklin’s greatest and why?

I think his greatest achievement was his particpation in the creation of the Declaration of Independence.
I think it his greatest achievement because it was a very important moment for the

        - British tax that the colonists felt that voilated their liberty
    - Hutchinson had defended Andrew Oliver (a relative) who was helping to administor the Stamp Act
    - Led by Ebenezer Mackintosh

## The Crisis Begins

### Consolidating the Empire

- 1760: King George III takes British crown
- Saw the colonies as just a way to enrich Britain
    - Contrast from the notion of "allies" during the Seven Years' War
    - Needed a way to pay for the war
- **Virtual representation**
    - Every member represented the country as a whole, not just the area they were from
    - The colonies and even major British cities (Manchester and Birmingham) were not represented
- **Writs of assistance**
    - General search warrants to search anywhere
    - To combat smuggling (and enforce Navigation Acts)
- Also not happy with the Proclamation of 1763

### Taxing the Colonies

- 1764: Sugar Act
    - Reduced tax on molasses
    - However, further shutdown smuggling
        - Courts often sided with the smuggler &rarr; they could be judged without a trial
    - Trying to enforce Navigation Acts
        - Now colonies were taxed directly instead of indirectly on the trade
        - Affected the colonial ports the most
- Currency Act
    - Confirmed the ban of using paper as "legal tender"
        - Coins or banknotes that must be accepted if offered in payment of a debt
- Stamp Act
    - Affected everyone
    - Led to British army stationed in America to enforce
    - Displeased many of the writers and those who controlled the press
    - Displeased the local elites who lost power as a result of this
    - "Property was taken away without consent"
        - Colonists wanted the rights of an Englishman

### Taxation and Representation

- Bristish saw colonies as outposts of an empire
    - They chose the represetives in America
- The colonists saw themselves as equals to those on the mainland
- Because they were unrepresented in Parliament, they could not be taxed by it
    - "No taxation without representation"
- House of Burgesses (Virginia) under Patrick Henry passed laws arguing for "British freedom"
    - Colonists should get same rights/liberties as British citizens because they were British citizens
- 1765: **Stamp Act Congress**
    - 27 delegates from 9 colonies
    - Still loyal and obedient to the crown
    - However, right to constent of taxation was essential to the freedom of a people
    - Resulted in boycotting all British goods
        - First time the colonies worked together

### Liberty and Resistance

- "Liberty" began becoming a common topic and took many forms of visual representation
- **Committe of Correspondence**
    - In Boston
    - Before Stamp Act was passed, spread word and encourged opposition to it (and the Currency Act)
- Resistance to the acts were often started by elites, but they spread to everyone
- 1765: **Sons of Liberty**
    - NYC residents led protests and enforced boycotting of British imports
- 1766: Britain repealed the Stamp Act
    - Did not expect American resistance to it
    - Also pressured by British merchants who were losing money
        - (Couldn't sell stuff to America with the boycotts)
- However, at the same time, Britain passed the **Declaratory Act**
    - Parliament had the right to tax the colonies in any case

### The Regulators

- As colonies expanded westward, there were more conflicts
    - Land disputes between settlers, colonial governments, and Indians
    - Liberty in relation to secure possession of land
        - Compared to liberty in relation to Stamp Tax was about taxes
- **Regulators**
    - Mid-1760s
    - Wealthy residents from the South Carolina backcountry
    - Protested the under representation of western settlements
    - As well as the failure to create local governments
- At the same time, in North Carolina some small farmers rebelled
    - Kidnapped local officals and refused to pay taxes
    - Caused general disruption
- Wanted democratization of local government
    - Went against the rich and powerful (the colony's elite)
- 1771: "battle of Alamance"
    - The farmers were suppressed by the colonial militia

## The Road to Revolution

### The Townshend Crisis

- 1767: **Townshend Acts**
    - Taxed glass, lead, paint, paper, and tea
    - During the Stamp Act, some colonists had said they would be okay on taxing trade
        - Just not taxing them directly
    - Also created a board to collect the taxes and further stop smuggling
- Opposition to it came slower than the Stamp Act
    - But by 1768, some colonies reinstanted the boycotts
- Led to increased independence from Britain
    - Began producing goods within America
        - Became a symbol of resistance
        - Daughters of Liberty: homespun clothes
    - Popular especially in the Chesapeake so the planters did not have to pay as much money to British merchants
    - Also reduced competition with British merchants

    - Eventually Townshend Acts were repealed and the boycotts ended
    - Tea tax remained

### The Tea Act

- The East India Company stock collapsed
    - It had a large monopoly over trade
    - Effectively ran British India
    - Many many people had invested in it
- To help the company (and thus its supporters), the British government tried to promote it in America
    - It was given rebates and tax exemptions
        - Underpriced local tea and smugglers in America
- Colonists saw this as an extention of the Declatory Act
    - It would acknowledge the right of Britain to tax the colonies
- 1773: **Boston Tea Party**
    - Threw 300 chests of tea off a ship and into the water
    - Cost them 10,000 (about 4 million today)

    - Created local Committees of Safety
        - Implement the mandates and punish "enemies of American liberty"
        - Transfered effective political power from the colonial governments (controlled by Britain)

### The Sweets of Liberty

    - Confident in their ability to retain control
- Novemeber 1775: **Lord Dunmore's Proclamation**
    - Offered freedom to slaves who fought for the British
    - Further enraged the South against Britain
- Because of high diversity in New York and Pennsylvania, they were more hesitant to break with Britain
    - Wanted peace with Britain
    - Feared internal conflict after break with Britain (sort of predicted Civil War)

### *Common Sense*

- January 1776: ***Common sense*** by Thomas Paine

    - Argued for independence
    - Did not just repeat grievences of the colonists
        - Reached a new audience, spread it to all the people, not just the elites

## Homework - 9/17: Moment of Decision! 1776

### 1) An introduction of your character: Rebecca Howe

I am a 48 year old single mother who is the owner of this inn.
Creating this buisness was hard, and has only been harder since he died 5 years ago.
Because of this, I am thankful for any visitors I get regardless of who they are or what they believe.
My rum is made from completely legal molasses and my son is definitely not a member of the rebel militia.

You are the forty-eight-year-old owner of a public inn at which this evening’s discussion is
taking place. You and your husband worked hard to build up your business. Since his death five years ago, the
burdens on you have grown heavier. The local British magistrate is a frequent visitor to your inn, and you are
grateful for the business he brings. Of course, you do not tell him that the rum you serve is made from smuggled
molasses. You also do not dare admit that your son is a member of the rebel militia in your county. You are very
worried that he may go off to war.

### 2) An explanation of your top option: 2

My top option is option 2.
My son "is a member of the rebel militia" and I am "very worried that he may go off to war" (and die), 
so I do not agree with options 3 or 4 which want us (my son) to fight.
I agree more with option 2 than than option 1 because I agree some things do need to change,
otherwise I would not even be hosting this discussion.
For example, the rum I make "is made from smuggled molasses" which I would not have to do if things were different.
However, I don't have anything particularly against the British,
and the "local British magistrate is a frequent visitor to" my inn
which provides good buisness.

While I am leaning toward Option 2, I could be persuaded to Option 1.

### 3) Generate at least one question for each of the other options

| Option | Question |
| :- | :- |
| 1 | Shortly after the Stamp Acts were repealed, we were hit by the Townshend Acts which had many of the same problems as the Stamp Acts and had the same outcome. Don't you think it's time for change now rather than just be used to help Britain? |
| 3 | While Britain could have treated us better, do you really think that it is best to risk our lives for something that could be solved with discussion? We did end up getting the Stamp Acts and Townshend Acts repealed. |
| 4 | Is it really best to leave Britain? We owe our entire existance on these lands to them. |

### 4) Look over and take notes on the bios of the other characters

Key:
- " ": No
- &#9744;: Sort of/not clear
- &#9745;: (Mostly) yes

### Other notes

#### Option 1

Beliefs and Assumptions Underlying Option 1:
1. No society on earth enjoys greater liberty and prosperity than the American colonies. Much of our good fortune, especially with respect to trade, is due to our status within the British Empire.
2. Accepting the authority o Parliament is a reasonable price to pay for Britain’s protection of the colonies
3. We are called upon by God to respect the legitimate authority of government.

Supporting Argument for Option 1:
1. The colonies will be crushed militarily and ruined economically by a full-scale war of rebellion
2. Breaking our ties with Britain will embolden the lower classes to challenge the authority of their betters
3. Without the unifying force of British rule and the protection of the British navy, the colonies will squabble among themselves and present an inviting target for aggressive foreign powers

#### Option 2

Beliefs and Assumptions Underlying Option 2:
1. The legitimacy of Britain’s authority over the colonies is grounded in the mother country’s discover, settlement and continuous protection of America.
2. The colonies should be required to contribute their fair share to defend the British Empire in North America.
3. Under the British constitutional system, the citizens of the colonies should have a voice in making the laws
that govern them, especially in the area of taxation.

Supporting Arguments for Option 2:
1. Establishing a joint British-American council—on equal footing with Parliament—to govern the colonies will protect both the rights of the colonists and the legitimate authority of Britain.
2. Resistance to British rule will bring economic disaster to the colonies.
3. Without British authority over them, the individual colonies will turn against each other and plunge into civil war.

## Homework Questions - 9/19

1. What, according to the first paragraph, is the purpose of the Declaration of Independence?

The purpose is to seperate politically from Britain and to form a new nation where the opinions of the people are respected.

2. What groups do you think Jefferson and the Continental Congress hoped to persuade with this document?

Everyone.
They hoped to pursaude the colonists to support/fight the United States of America.
And they hoped to open the eyes of everyone globally to these ideas such as unalienable rights and the consent of the governed.

3. According to Jefferson, what is the purpose of government?
Who has the right to create or establish a government?

Jefferson thought that the purpose of government was to secure and protect the unalienable rights of the people (life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness).
The people have the right to create or establish a government (or to abolish it).

4. Jefferson intended the Declaration of Independence to be universal, applying to any people or nation.
As a result, he did not mention any specific laws or actions by Britain in his list of grievances,
but rather referred to the general violation of rights they represented.
Select any five grievances mentioned by Jefferson and identify the specific law or act that lies behind that grievance.

- “For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us” = The Quartering Act
- "He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, and also uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their Public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures." = The 1774 change to the Massachusetts Charter of 1691
- "He has obstructed the Administration of Justice by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers." = Starting in 1774, the king appointed all the Massachusetts's judges
    - The judges were dependent on the king for their salaries and subject to his directions
- "He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures." = Colonists saw the soldiers as tools for the British to enforce the Stamp Act/Townshend Acts
    - And the Quartering Act after the Boston Tea Party
- "For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world". = The Navigation Acts

5. What legal means did the colonists take to try to convince the British to change their repressive policies
(think back on our timeline of events leading to the American Revolution)?
How did the king and parliament respond to these concerns (again, the timeline can be your guide)?

The colonists got the Stamp Act and most of the Townshend Acts repealed.
They also boycotted British goods.

6. What did Jefferson conclude was necessary for the colonists to do in light of these repeated responses, or what he calls these “long train of abuses and usurpations”?

Jefferson concluded that the colonists have to break from the British government
and create a new government that will actually protect and benefit the people in it.

7. Those who signed the Declaration of Independence risked everything, including, as they say at the end of the Declaration,
“our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.”
Click on one of the names of the signers of the Declaration of Independence (above) and write a brief (just a few sentences is fine) summary of who they were and, if provided, what happened to them during and after the war. 

William Ellery, Rhode Island:

He went to Harvard and graduated when he was just 15 years old.
He did not find his perfect career for a while, but eventually became a lawyer.

He was appointed to the Marine committee and later helped others including the committee for foreign relations.
He held the office of judge of the Supreme Court of Rhode Island.
By 1785, he was a strong supporter of the abolition of slavery.

    - 1764: married John Adams
    - Kept an eye on politics and family when he went to war
    - 1776: commented on slavery and how it did not fit with the revolutions ideals of equality
    - #1 role of women: family, but husbands did not have full power over their wives
- She was an example of how other people wanted more freedoms inspired by the revolution
    - Many did not have full freedom: slaves, indentured servants, women, Indians,l apprentices, those without property

## Democratizing Freedom

### The Dream of Equality

- The American Revolution happened on 3 levels:
    1. A fight for national independence
    2. A segment of the ongoing global battle amomg European empires
    3. A conflict over what kind of a nation free America would be
- The revolution sparked debates against other previously held beliefs/strutures
    - Saw Britain as a representation of the old way and old problems
        - Also rejected patronage, fixed status
    - Liberty became a standard to judge all institutions (both homegrown and imperial)
- "All men are created equal" went against a lot of current standing structures
    - Slavery, king over subjects, husband over wife, etc
    - Inequality was at the time a core part of life

### Expanding the Political Nation

- People in marginalized groups challenged the domination of the few in power
- After the revolution, you did not have to own property to vote
    - But husbands still had power over wifes and in the South, slavery remained
- Democracy had different meanings
    - Aristotle: a system wgere the entire people govern directly
    - Became more about better representation
        - Everyone dissuced politics and could at least have part of a say
        - Universal male suffrage, religious toleration, abolition of slavery

### The Revolution in Pennsylvania

- The prewar elites were against independence
    - Feared cutting ties would lead to them losing power and attacks on their properties
- Poltical power vacuum filled by pro-independence people from lower/middle class
    - Critized the qualifications for voting
- After the independence, Pennsylvania adopted a one house legislature
    - Elected annually by men over 21 who paid taxes
    - Removed governor and the need to own property to run for an office
    - Set up low cost schooling
    - Garenteed freedom of speech, press, and writing

### The New Constitutions

- Almost all Americans agreed to a **republic**
    - Government authority comes from the people
    - No king or hereditary aristocracy
- 1776: John Adam's *Thoughts on Government*
    - Counteract radicalism (seen by Pennsylvania)
    - Governments should be balanced between wealthy (upper house) and poor (lower house)
        - Checks and balances between the two
    - Many states adopted two house systems
    - In all but Massachusetts, the governor did not have the power to veto the legislature

### The Right to Vote

- John Adams | freedom and equality are opposites
    - Removal of property qualifications for voting would put everyone on the same level (JA | bad)
- In the South, the landed gentry retained much of the power
    - Democracy would mean they would lose power
- Universal **suffrage** did not really happen
    - Ex: Pennsylvania dropped property qualifications, but still had to pay taxes to vote
    - However, still siginificantly more people could vote

## Toward Religious Freedom

- Pre revolution: some toleration as a result of relgious pluralism
    - Not because of well formed religious toleration theories

### Catholic Americans

- The War of Independence weakened anti-Catholic feelings in America (most were Protestant)
    - Alliance with Catholic French and Spain
- Proved to the Americans that Catholics played a role in their independence
    - Full rights of an Englishman did not just apply to Protestants

### Separating Church and State

- Many were for the separating of church and state
    - Free government from religious influence and protect it from corruption
- States did not directly fund churches
    - Churchs also did not have special privileges
- Not complete
    - All states but New York barred Jews from poltical affairs
    - Massachusetts kept its Congregationalist establishment

### Jefferson and Religious Liberty

- 1779: **Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom**
    - By Thomas Jefferson for Virginia
    - 1786: Passed by House of Burgesses
    - Eliminated religious requirements for office and voting
    - Eliminated state funding of churches
    - Stopped the state from forcing a religion on someone
- Religion became an example of a private right that should be protected from government influence
    - Line between private life and public authority
- American should be an asylum for those being persecuted and oppresed of every nation and religion

### Christian Republicanism

- Merge of religious and secular struggle during the War of Independence
- Evangelical religion and republic government both belived that without moral restraint (provided by government and religion) human nature would crumble to corruption
- Some saw the American Revolution as a part of god's plan to promote the development of a good society
    - World could change (did not have to be destoryed before Christ comes)

### A Virtuous Citizenry

- Current leaders wanted to promote "virtue": sacrfice self-interest for the good of the community
- Created free state-supported schools to teach the principles of freedom
- Believed strong education was core to the future of the nation

## Defining Economic Freedom

### Toward Free Labor

- The Revolution charged the definition of freedom
    - Unfree labor was on a specturm
- The middle section rapidly declined (indentured servants and apprenticeship)
    - That work was taken up by women and blacks
    - These ideas were not compatible with republican citizenship
- But slavery remained
    - A further divide between free and slavery
    - North: free labor (wage working or owning a farm/shop)
    - South: slavery

### The Soul of a Republic

- People were caught up in the social conditions of freedom
- Some thought the government should the accumilation of property in the same of equality
    - However, others thought that equality should mean equal oppertunity
- Many leaders thought that the natural workings of society would produce justice, liberty, and equality
- Jefferson | lack economic resources = lack freedom
    - Passed laws abolishing the entail (inheritance to a specific line of heirs) and primogeniture (the eldest son inherits everything)
        - Prevent the rise of future aristocracy

### The Politics of Inflation

- The Revolution was a time of inflation
    - The government printed money to pay for the war
    - And disruption if agriculture and trade (because they were all fighting)
- Some thought the government should limit price increases
- 1776-1779: >30 mob/raids against merchants accused of holding goods off the markets

### The Debate over Free Trade

- 1779: inflation out of control
    - Congress urged states to try to fix wages and prices
        - Task of republican government was to promote public good
            - Not nessissarly individuals' self-intrests
- When the a Committee of Safety tried to control prices, it was opposed
    - **Free trade**: the government should not interfere with the market, it will regulate itself
        - Economic devolopment was a result of economic self-intrest
        - 1776: Adam Smith's ***The Wealth of Nations***
            - Invisible hand of the free market would be more fair and effective than government intervention
    - Also against it because of Navigation Acts
- Opposing views of economic freedom
    - Intrests of the community > property rights of individuals
    - Unregulated economic freedom would produce social harmony and public gain

## The Limits of Liberty

### Colonial Loyalists

- **Loyalists**: colonists who remained loyal to the British crown
    - 20-25% of the population
    - Most numerous in New York, Pennsylvania, the Carolinas, and Georgia
    - Some feared anarchy if the ties were cut, others depended on relations with Britain (lawyers, merchants, Anglican ministers, imperial officials)
- The fight for independence increased already existing social tension

### The Loyalists' Plight

- New state governments and crowds of patriots suppressed loyalists
    - Stopped newspapers though to be loyal to Britain
    - Seized loyalist property (and Quaker, Mennonites, Moravians who were pacifists and refused to fight against Britain)
    - Some states required an oath of alligence to the new nation
- At the end of the war, 60k loyalists left America either by choice or by force
- 1783: Treaty of Paris
    - Americans would not presecute loyalists and land taken during the war would be given back

### White Freedom, Indian Freedom

- Liberty for whites meant loss of liberty for Indians
    - Allowed whites the opportunity to take land from the Indians
- 1783: Treaty of Paris
    - Britain gave all rights to the land to the Americans (did not mention Indians)

## Slavery and the Revolution

- Indians experienced American independence as a real threat to their liberty
- African-Americans saw the ideals of the Revolution and the reality of war as an opportunity to claim freedom

### The Language of Slavery and Freedom

- Other than "liberty", "slavery" was the most common word in legal and political literature
- In debates over British rule: "slavery" - denial of personal/political rights by government
    - Political category
    - Lacked a say in public affairs = "enslaved"
- It was apparent that slavery did not fit with the Revolution ideals
    - Many leaders had many slaves

### Obstacles to Abolition

- Slavery was an old institution
    - Existed in every colony
    - Large part of the economy (and social structure)
- Some thought slavery of blacks enabled white freedom
    - By owning slaves it allowed whites to be economically autonomous
        - An important part of freedom

### The Cause of General Liberty

- The Revolution defined freedom as a universal entitlement
    - Not a soecific set of rights for a specific group of people
- 1700: Samuel Sewall's *The Selling of Joseph*
    - First antislavery printed in America
    - All were entitled to equal rights of freedom
        - Common idea with Pennsylvania' Quakers
- 1773: Benjamin Rush - slavery was a national crime that would result in national punishment

### Petitions for Freedom

- Slaves demanded that the leaders uphold their ideas of freedom
- **Freedom petitions**: arguments for liberty presented by enslaved African-Americans
    - Presented to New England's courts and legislatures in 1770s
- Some slaves tried to run away and pass as free borns
    - Rise of fugitive-slave advertisements rose in 1770s and 1780s
- 1776: **Lemuel Haynes**
    - Black militia member and later minister
    - If liberty was innate for all mankind, Africans were included
    - Wanted Americans to understand slavery as a denial of essential of freedom
        - Not lack of political representation
- Most slaves were only 1-2 generations from Africa
    - Did not need the Revolution's ideals of freedom
    - Their parents/grandparents were born free in Africa

### British Emancipators

- 5,000 slaves fought for American independence and got their freedom
- Many more got their freedom from the British
    - 1775: Lord Dunmore's Proclamation
    - 1779: Philipsburg Proclamation (General Henry Clinton)
        - Freedom to non-loyalist slaves who escape
    - 10s of thousands of slaves
    - 1/4 of South Carolina's slaves
    - 1/3 of Georgia's slaves
- Some escaped slaves were recaptured by the Americans
    - But still 15,000 got away
        - Went to Nova Scotia, England, Sierra Leone
- Compesation for escaped slaves hurt US-Britain relations
    - 1827: Britain paid 1,100 Americans who lost slave property

### Voluntary Emancipations

- During the War of Independence many states banned/discouraged importation of slaves from Africa
- War ruined many Southern plantations
- 1780s-1790s: slaveholders, especially Virginians and Marylanders, willing freed their slaves
    - 1796: Richard Randolph freed his slaves (~90) and gave them part of his land
- Further South, voluntary Emancipation did not really happen
    - South Carolina refused to allow slaves to fight in the war
        - Would rather lose war than lose slaves

### Abolition in the North

- 1777: Vermont banned slavery
- 1804: New Jersey also (last of the states North of Maryland to take action towards abolition)
- Mostly did not grant emancipation
    - Liberty for children born of a slave, but they often had to serve into adulthood
        - To compensate the owner's economic loss
- Abolition of slavery in the North was slow
    - 1790: first national census
        - 21,000 slaves in New York
        - 11,000 slaves in New Jersey
    - 1830: 3,500 slaves in the North
    - New Yorker John Jay - chief justice of the US: 5 slaves in 1800

### Free Black Communities

- Division over ideas of slavery seperated the North and South
- Due to abolition in the North and voluntary emacipation in the upper south, sizable number of **free blacks**
    - Often took the last names "Freeman" or "Freeland"
- 1776 &rarr; 1810: 10k &rarr; 200k free blacks in US
- Many in the North had a right to vote
- But slavery survived the independence and was still growning
- 1776 &rarr; 1790: 500k &rarr; 700k slaves in US

## Daughters of Liberty

### Revolutionary Women

- Many women contributed to the war
    - Crowd actions against merchants, raused funds to assit soldiers, made goods for the army, spied on British
    - 1782: Deborah Sampson enlisted in Continental Army
- Within households women participated in political discussions
    - Still limited by **coverture** (public politics still heavily male dominated)
        - Republican citizen basicially equaled "male"

### Republican Motherhood

- Women play the critical role of educating future citizens
    - Required themselves to have a good education
- "Companionate marriage": voluntary union and mutal dependency
    - Not male dominated
- Decline of slaves and indentured servants meant that "family" = parents children
    - Didn't include wage workers

### The Arduous Struggle for Liberty

- Plus liberty:
    - Right to vote expanded
    - Religious groups had more freedom
    - Many blacks got their freedom
    - Women (in some ways) had a higher status
- Minus liberty:
    - Indians, many loyalists, slaves
- American Revolution inspired French Revolution

## Homework Question - 9/25 - The American Revolution and Liberty

*To what extent did minority or marginalized groups (African Americans, Native Americans, women) participate in or benefit from the liberties achieved by the American Revolution?*

In this speech the Native Americans were trying to participate in the liberties
achieved by the American Revolution by asking for the right to have a say in what
happens to them/their land.
They specifically ask for the American
"surveyors and others that mark out land to cease from crossing the Ohio until we shall have spoken to you"
because they are worried about future land conflicts before a more permenent solution is in place.
They are also asking for the Americans to not nessissarly forget but to proceed
in a better than they have in the past ("We shall then bury in oblivion the misfortunes that have happened and meet each other on a footing of friendship").

The Native Americans also list a few grievances they have about what the Americans
did in the past. For example the Americans
"kindled your council fires where you thought proper, without consulting us, at which you held separate treaties, and have entirely neglected our plan of having a general conference with the different nations of the confederacy."
This directly leds them to ask for
"a treaty with you early in the spring" and "all partial treaties as void and of no effect."
They finish the speech by basically saying we offered our terms which are very fair,
but if they are not followed we will use force to defend ourselves.

# Chapter 7 - Founding a Nation

    - Diverse people (ethnic, religious, etc)
        - 700k slaves
        - Less common nationality
    
## America under the Confederation

### The Articles of Confederation

- 1777: Congress drafts the **Articles of Confederation**
    - First written US constition
    - Ratified 4 years later
    - Tried to balance control needed to coordinate during the War of Independence without widespread fear of centralized political power
        - Could do just what was needed for the war
            - Declare war, conduct foreign affairs, make treaties
            - Could not tax or regulate trade
    - More of a treaty of mutal defense than a government
        - 13 states retained individual sovereignty
        - 1 house Congress
            - Each state had 1 vote (regardless of population)
            - Decisions required 9/13 votes
        - No executive or judicial branch
    - Required 13/13 votes to amend
    - However, it did establish national control over western lands

### Congress, Settlers, and the West

- National land domain stretched to Mississippi River
    - 10,000 Indians lived in that area
- Congress decided that by supporting the British, the Indians gave up all claim to the land
    - Did not differniate between the different tribes
- 1784-1785: American governemnt got large surrenders of Indian land
    - Government was unsure what to do with the land
        - Economic health: farmers get the land
        - Or money from land sales
- After the war, many Americans moved West
    - Saw the right to take possession of Western lands as a part of American freedom
    - 1785: Ohioans petition Congress to let land ownership be given to "actual settlements"
    - Government (like the British) saw unregulated flow of Americans into Indian land as a catalyst for conflict

### The Land Ordinances

- Series of measures that defined how western land would be marketed and settled
- **Ordinance of 1784**
    - Thomas Jefferson
    - Divided the land into 3 sections that would be governed by Congress
        - Later would be admitted into the Union as states
    - Slave was allowed to continue (1 vote short of banning slavery in West)
- **Ordinance of 1785**
    - For land sales north of the Ohio River
    - Land would be surveyed and cut into 1 square mile sections
        - Land would be sold at 1 square mile at $640 ($1 per acre)
        - In each township, one section would be for public education
- **Northwest Ordinance of 1787**
    - Creation of 3-5 states north of Ohio River and east of Mississpi
    - Good treatment of Indians
        - Don't take their land
        - Some thought it would cost less to have good relations than to war against them
    - Offically banned slavery
        - Some settlers still brought slaves and lied about it
        - Increased North/South divide
- **Empire of liberty**
    - Instead of ruling the West like a colony, they would be added as equal members to the poltical system
    - High focus on self-governce of those new lands
- Americans found it difficult to regulate desire for new land
    - Something the British also struggled with
    - $640 however, was too much for most settlers
        - Until Homestead Act of 1862, people wanted lower priced land

### The Confederation's Weakness

- Economic problems
    - To pay for the war, borrowed money by selling intrest bonds or paying in notes to be redeemed later
        - However, later the government had no way to make money
            - Could not trade with West Indies (no longer a British colony)
            - Imported goods - drained money from the country
    - 1784: *Empress of China* - first US trade with Asia
        - Profitable, but did not make up for loss of West Indies trade
- States adopted own economic polices
    - Tariffs
    - Some states printed money to help people pay of debts and increase the amount of curreny in circulation
    - Some postponed debts
        - Creditors thought that was an attack on their property rights

### Shay's Rebellion

- 1786-1787: Daniel Shays led a rebellion of debt-ridden farmers in western Massachusetts
    - Farmers were upset about the state's economic policies
- Wanted to stop courts from seizing their land
- Used the same tatics used in the 1760s-1770s
- No sympathy from Governor James Bowdion
    - Dispatched an army against them
- Thomas Jefferson | A little rebellion here and there is good
    - Liberty much be refreshed every so often
- Led people to believe that the government needed to be strengthned
    - Uniform economic policies
    - Protect property rights from local majorities
    - People realized too much freedom could be an issue
        - Un checked power of the people could be bad

### Nationalists of the 1780s

- James Madison
    - Virginia, ally of Thomas Jefferson
    - Wanted to strengthen the government
- Alexander Hamilton
    - From West Indies
    - Wanted an "energetic" government
        - Allow America to be a world power
- Idea of stronger government popular with army officers, members of Congress, and diplomats
    - Also people owed money by the government, artisans who wanted tariffs, and merchants who wanted to trade with Europe
- 1786: Delagates from 6 states meet to find a better way to regulate trade
    - Proposed another gathering to amend the Articles of Confederation
        - Meet in 1787
            - All by Rhode Island attend (they already had advanced debt and trade polices)
            - Decide to start over and get rid of Articles of Confederation

## A New Constitution

- 1787: **Constitutional Convention**
    - 55 people attend
        - Smart people, wealthy, educated, slave owning
    - Held in private to ensure free debate
- At this time less than 1% of Americans attended college

### The Structure of the Government

- 3 branches - legislative, executive, judicial
- Congress would have the power to raise money (indepenant of the states)
- States could not interfere with property rights
- Goal: balance between monarchy + aristocracy and excessive democracy
- Madison: **Virginia Plan**
    - Two house legislature with state pop. determining number of reps
    - Better for bigger states
- **New Jersey Plan**
    - Single house legislature with each state having 1 vote (like AoC)
- Result: two house legislature
    - Senate: 2 votes per state
        - 6 year terms
    - House of Representatives: number of reps based on state pop.
        - 2 year terms
        - Elected by the people

### The Limits of Democracy

- Under AoC, no national officals chosen by popular vote
- HoR was an expansion of liberty
    - No property or relgious qualifications for voting
- But wanted to protect government from swigns and enthusiasms (seen in 1780s)
    - HoR kept small
        - Started at 65 reps total so that only the "right" kind of person could win a seat
    - No direct election for president or supreme court
        - President by electoral college or HoR
            - State electors by its legislature or pop. vote
    - SC elected for life
- Presidental election was complicated
    - Runner up = vice president

### The Division and Separation of Powers

- Constituion was only the outline of the structure for the government
- Based on 2 prinicples:
    1. **Federalism** - **division of powers**
        - Strong national government, weak state governments
        - President in charge of enforcing the law and the military
        - Congress could tax, regulate trade, declare war, borrow money, foregin affairs (and with Indians), and promote general welfare
        - States could not print money, interfere with property rights or contracts or interstate commerce, or tax
        - States still in charge of day to sday stuff
            - Education, police
    2. **Checks and balances** - **separation of powers**
        - Prevent any branch from becoming to OP
        - President could veto laws put by Congress
            - But 2/3 (super majority) of Congress could override
        - Supreme Court judges are nominated by president and confirmed by Sentate
        - President can be impeached by Congress

### The Debate over Slavery

- Constitution protected slavery
    - Congress can not ban importing slaves in the next 20 years
    - States had to return fugitives to their owners
    - **3/5 clause**
        - 3/5 of slavery pop. counted to HoR and electoral college pop. count
        - Signifcant power to South states
- But anti-slavery measures in place
    - Slavery not a property
    - Not national

### Slavery in the Constitution

- Its slavery clauses were a middle ground
- Slave trade in US resumed after War of Independence until 1808
    - Instantly banned further importing of slaves as soon as it could
    - But in the meantime, 170k African slaves imported
        - Replace slaves lost to British in WoI
        - Farm the new western land
- Slave laws were extraterritoriality
    - Escaped slave in a different state is still a slave and must be returned
    - Ambigious, did not say who is responsible for this

### The Final Document

- Clear simple language
- Changed language to appeal to the people as a whole unified nation

## Homework Questions - 9/27 - Ben Franklin, On the Faults of the Constitution

1. As noted in the introduction, if anyone had the right or ability to assess the merits and
shortcomings of the Constitution, it was Ben Franklin. Why then do you think he spends the
first full paragraph of his “critique” saying what he does? What is the main purpose or
message of his first paragraph?

He is saying that everyone thinks they are right and this also applies to him.
He also says he is old, which means he has much experience and wisdom,
but he is also ready to accept other people's opinions.

2. What, according to Franklin, are the Constitutions main weaknesses or its greatest
vulnerabilities? Put another way: What is the biggest threat to American democracy?

He thinks a threat to the American democracy is not doing anything.
If they stall or become "confounded" it will benefit the British.
Or if the states cannot agree and end up in conflict against eachother.

3. Was there anything about Franklin’s reflections that surprised you, stood out to you,
impressed you or disappointed you? In short, what did you find interesting, perplexing or
thought-provoking about Franklin’s remarks?

I think it is intresting that he sees a convention of men as both a positive and a negative.
He says you get the "advantage of their joint wisdom" but also "all their prejudices, their passions, their errors of opinion, their local interests, and their selfish views".
He also recognizes that it may not be possible to have drafted a better/perfect constition
because of this.

## Class Notes - 9/29

- Seperation of powers != checks and balances
- Not all powers are equal
    - Difference in total power and power to check other branches

### Seperation of powers

- 3 sections

#### Legislative

- Congress refers to both houses
    - Senate

- Both houses have to approve a bill before it can become a law
    - Majority vote in both houses
        - If there is a tie in the senate, the vice president votes
        - Filibuster
            - To move from debating to voting, 60% of the senate must stop debating

#### Executive

- President
    - Head of state
        - Ceremonial, symbolic, a figure

        - Picked by president

#### Judicial

- Supreme Court
    - High culture, sets precedent
    - Top of the pyramid
- Other federal courts
    - Bricks in the pyramid (a lot more of these than SC)
    - More then just 1 level
        - If you lose a court case, you can appeal to a higher court
        - Court "curcuit"
- All judges are picked by president

### Checks and balances

- Make sure no body is too powerful
    - Prevent another Britain over colonies situation
- ![https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gUf71LHlRrkTDQDGLKvbs2ormGkD_2pYoLvfNFdEjjo/edit](./Unit2/ChecksAndBalances.png)

## The Ratification Debate and the Origin of the Bill of Rights

### *The Federalist*

- Constitution would go into effect when 9 states ratified it
    - (Not 13 as needed by AoC)
- Each state had elections for delegates for a ratification convention
    - Public battle to elect delegates
        - Pamplets, newspaper articles, and compaigns
- Hamilton, Madison, and Jay wrote a series of essays to convince people to ratify the constitution
    - 85 essays collected into a book (***The Federalist***)
    - Under penned name (Publius)
    - Argued that the stronger government actually further protected the rights of the people
        - Balance between liberty and power

### "Extend the Sphere"

- Madison argued that the Constitution was the designed to prevent abuses of power
- *The Federalist* nos. 10, 15 - government is subject to the will of the people, but the people are subject to dangerous enthusiasms
    - Problem of balancing democracy and respect for the rights (property rights) would only grow
        - Economic development &rarr; more poor people 
        - How to stop them from using their political power to take away the property of the rich
    - Will not be a problem in the US though
        - The US's size is a strength, too large and too many conflicting interests for a single group to dominate

### The Anti-Federalists

- Against the ratification of the Constitution
    - The balance of liberty and power was too close to power
- Did not have the leaders the Federalists had
    - No one to write a book of essays
- Supported by:
    - State politicians who did not want to lose power
    - Small farmers who did not see the need for a strong government
    - Pro slavery people who either thought the Constitution limited slavery or Congress had the power to abolish it
- Thought the new government would become influenced by merchants, creditors (or other "bad" people)
    - Popular self government was better in smaller communities
    - The "common people" would become ruled by the "well-born"
- Thought the happiness of America came from the lack of limitions of the institutions and the limitations on government
- The Constitution did not have a **Bill of Rights**
    - Trial by jury, freedom of speech/press, etc were not protected
    - Madison promised that the first Congress would create a Bill of Rights
- Pro-consitution was more city/marketplace based
    - Government could improve economy
    - Anti-Federalists were more rural based
- 1787: only 12 of the 92 American newspapers were Anti-Federalist
- 1788: the 9 states required for ratification were met
    - Only Rhode Island and North Carolina were against it
        - But they didn't really have a choice)

### The Bill of Rights

- The first 10 amendements
    - 1791: ratified
- Not part of the original Constitution document
    - Freedom of speech/press/religion, equality before the law, etc
    - Madison say this as redundant and wouldn't actually help when needed ("parchment barrier")
        - But many people (Federalists and Anti-Federalists) thought it was important
1. Congress cannot limit freedom of speech, or right to assembly
    - Can not legislate against religion
2. Right to "bear arms" and militia
- Others:
    - No arrest without warrant
    - Accused does not have to testify against themselves
    - Right to trial by jury
- Relgiious freedom
    - Represents change in American society
    - The DoI was at least in part relgious
    - The Constitution is completely secular
        - No reference to God
