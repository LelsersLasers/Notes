### Indians of Eastern North America

- Hundreds of tribes between Gulf of Mexico and Canada
    - Lived on squash, corn, beans, and hunted/fished
- Until 5th century, there was no central authority
    - Warred frequently
- Leagues/confederations emerged to unite local areas
    - Southeast: Choctaw, Cherokee, Chicksaw
    - Northeast: 5 Iroquois formed a **Great League of Peace**
        - Mohawk, Oneida, Cayuga, Seneca, Onondaga
- Each group was very different
    - Different politics, religions, languages
    - Identified locally (not countries, etc)

### Native American Religion

- Groups were similair in some ways
    - Focus on relgions, often in relation to hunting/farming
    - Spritual power/spirits infused in everything
        - Wanted the aid of the spirits
    - Religous rites and religious authority structure

### Land and Property

- Village leaders asssigned land to families
    - Families had a right to use the land, but did not own it (not real estate)
- Tribes claimed land for hunting
    - Unclaimed land could be used by anyone
- Sometimes moved often for new/better land
    - Didn't collect wealth/material goods
- Social status mattered, but reputation came from willingness to share goods
    - Trade was more than commerical (generosity was most valued)

    - "Noble savages": gentle, friendly, superior in some ways
    - Uncivilized barbarians
- Negative veiws later overshadowed positive ones
- Barbaric on 3 areas:
    1. Religion - not genuine relgion or the devil
    2. Land use - land was a commodity, not a world of spirits
        - Spanish claimed land by right of conquest and papal authority
        - English/French/Dutch claimed land by saying the natives did not actually "use" the land
    3. Gender relations - weak men and mistreated women

    - Did not live under government or fixed laws
    - Did not use European definitions of authority
    - Lacked order and discipline present in Europe
    - Did not attatch freedom to individual autonomy or property ownership
- Indian freedom:

    - Freedom to follow spirtual values
    - Well-being and security of the community

### Christian Liberty

- Freedom from sin: abandon a life of sin ("Christian Liberty")

- Religion inseparable from "secular" matters
    - Religion closely tied to economic, politcal, and social status
- Religous unity was important to pubic order

### Freedom and Authority

- Early European societies were hierarchical
    - Men > women and children
        - "Coverture": when a women married, she lost legal identity to husband
        - King over subjects = husband over family
            - Both "ordained" by God

### Liberty and Liberties

- Liberty came from fullfilling the duties appropriate to one's rank
- Most men lacked the freedom of economic independence
    - Largely controlled and dominated by upper classes
- Remenats of Middle Age "liberties"
    - Formal specific privilages: self-government, no taxes, right to practice a specific trade

## Homework Question - 8/22

How can scienctific analysis help us understand history?
Please draw examples from the article and any other examples which come to mind.

Scienctific analysis can help us understand history by uncovering new previously unknown information.
For example, in one part of the article talks about the split between the Andes' lowland and highland people about 8,750 years ago.
Without scienctific analysis we would not have the ability to track the split and the differences of DNA between the highland and lowland people.
This would make it impossible to estimate the the amount of lives lost due to European contact, which is an import part of history.
Scienctific analysis also can help us look much further into the past.
For example it can provide insight on things like the end of the dinosaurs or the formation of universe.

## Homework Questions - 8/24

1. According to this article, what are some of the reasons why Columbus might be considered a hero? A villain?

| Hero | Villain |
| :- | :- |
| - United the people of the world (trade of ideas, goods, etc) | - Brought slavery with him (and disease) |
| - Started the process of the creation of the US (and the good that came from it) | - Partially responsable for the things that came after him |

2. Dr. Fernández-Armesto lists several principles that should control our evaluation of historical people and events.
Which of these is the most interesting, intriguing or significant to you?
Do you disagree with any or would you add any?

I think the idea that contextalization is important is important, especally when looking at good and evil.
It would be unfair to say Columbus was a villain because he believed in slavery.
In the US, 4 of the first 5 presidents owned slaves, but they were still good people that helped many people.

3. What does the author mean when he says for some “moral indignation with Columbus is too precious to discard” and for others “kinship with a culture hero is too profound a part of America’s sense of identity to be easily excised”?
Being transparent about our own biases, which of these categories do you feel you are more likely to fall into?

The author means that people want to believe a partial version of a truth that fits their view of the world.
I think I fall somewhere inbetween.
I would be slightly biased towards "Columbus the villain" because I think it's easier to see the negative consquences than the benefits.
(Killing 1 person carries more weight than saving 1 person.)

4. So was Columbus a hero or a villain? Related to this, should we or should we not commemorate Columbus Day?

Life does not work in black and white.
He should not be be seen as a hero or a villain, but somewhere inbetween.
I think we should not celebrate "Columbus Day" as "Columbus" Day, but something that focuses more about both the new world wide connection and the downsides/consquences. (Celebrated as a day marking the beginning of change.)

The Mayflower Compact calls the government a "Civil Body Politic".
The government will meet repeatly with the purpse of creating
equal laws, ordiances, acts, constitions, and offices.

3. In what ways might this document be viewed as a “precursor” to the Declaration of
Independence and the Constitution?
In what ways is it different from these documents?

The government is made from multiple people and it will create equal laws.
A main complaint leading to the Declaration of Independence was unequal taxing

It is different in the way that the people "promise all due submission and obedience".

### Harvard Alma Mater Song

1. Should Harvard change the lyrics to its Alma Mater Song?

Yes.
I think that it should be updated to match the current ideas of inclusion.
It is different than changing the words of a textbook or document.
It is not hiding the past.
The song serves a different purpose, it is supposed to be a welcoming song,
not a historical document.

2. Why is it important whether or not Harvard made the change?

It does sort of change history.
All the new students will hear the new version and have a different idea of what Harvard
is compared to those before.
It further detaches Harvard from its past.

3. How does this discussion relate to other questions of historical legacy and memory in America?

People will forget about this change, and the updated song will sort of overwrite the original in history.

## Homework Questions - 8/31

1. What is the Flushing Remonstrance?
Who drafted it, why, and what is its basic message?

Settlers drafted it in 1657 in Flushing.
They wanted to petition the Dutch colonial government uphold freedom of conscience and permit religious pluralism.

2. Why do you think Governor Stuyvesant rejected the Remonstrance?
Are there any understandable or justifiable reasons for him to deny religious or ideological diversity in this new colony?

He rejected it because he would only tolerate his Dutch Reformed Church (and the Remonstrance went against that idea).

3. What has been the legacy of the Remonstrance?

It was the first document in America to argue for religious freedom.
Also the people did not just argue/petition to solve their own problems, they argued for everyone's right to choose.
It lead to Queens being one of the most divese country in the US.
However, there is no proof that later advocators for rights
(like those who wrote the Bill of Rights, Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, or the Declaration of Independence)
were influenced by the Remonstrance.
