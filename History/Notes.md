## The First Americans

### The Settling of the Americans

- First arrived by crossing Bering Strait land bridge 15,000 to 60,000 years ago
- Spread to South America 11,000
- Climate warmed -> food crisis as hunted animals became extinct
    - ~9,000 agriculture develops simultaneously in Near East and Mexico and Andes
    - Settled civilizations possible

### Indian Societies of the Americas

- When Europeans arrived, North/South Americas containted cities, roads, irrigation, trade networks, and large structures (pyramid-temples, etc)
    - Tenochtitlan
        - Captial of the Aztec empire
        - Pop. of 250,000
    - Inca kingdom:
        - Pop. 12 million 
        - Roads spread 2,000 miles along Andes mountains
- Indian civilizations in North America were not as big/centralized as Aztec or Inca and not as technologly advanced as Europe
    - Used to justify European conquest
    - But had: farming, hunting, fishing, politics, religion, trade, communication

### Mound Builders of the Mississippi River Valley

- 3,500 years ago, Native Americans constructed a large community
    - Built on mounds (Poverty Point) overlooking the Mississippi River ("mound builders"
    - Center of trade routes and government
- After mound builders another culture centered around Cahokia emerged (~1200)
    - Fortified with pop. of 10,000 to 30,000
    - Highest pop. in US until 1800 (overtaken by New York and Philadelphia)

### Western Indians

- Between 900 and 1200, Hopi and Zuni thrived in Arizona
    - Built towns, dams, canals and conducted trade far off
    - Constructed Pueblo Bonita, largest building in US until 1880s
    - Moved due to drought
        - Either into the desert (Pueblo Indians) or to the West Coast

### Indians of Eastern North America

- Hundreds of tribes between Gulf of Mexico and Canada
    - Lived on squash, corn, beans, and hunted/fished
- Until 5th century, there was no central authority
    - Warred frequently
- Leagues/confederations emerged to unite local areas
    - Southeast: Choctaw, Cherokee, Chicksaw
    - Northeast: 5 Iroquois formed a **Great League of Peace**
        - Mohawk, Oneida, Cayuga, Seneca, Onondaga
- Each group was very different
    - Different politics, religions, languages
    - Identified locally (not countries, etc)

### Native American Religion

- Groups were similair in some ways
    - Focus on relgions, often in relation to hunting/farming
    - Spritual power/spirits infused in everything
        - Wanted the aid of the spirits
    - Religous rites and religious authority structure

### Land and Property

- Village leaders asssigned land to families
    - Families had a right to use the land, but did not own it (not real estate)
- Tribes claimed land for hunting
    - Unclaimed land could be used by anyone
- Sometimes moved often for new/better land
    - Didn't collect wealth/material goods
- Social status mattered, but reputation came from willingness to share goods
    - Trade was more than commerical (generosity was most valued)

### Gender Relations

- Women could divorce and have premarital relations
- Most societies were matrilineal: centered on clans/kinship were children joined mother's not father's
- Indian women owned the dwelling and tools
    - Husband moved into wife's place
- Men often away on hunt
    - Wife mangaged house and agriculture

### European Views of the Indians

- Extreme terms:
    - "Noble savages": gentle, friendly, superior in some ways
    - Uncivilized barbarians
- Negative veiws later overshadowed positive ones
- Barbaric on 3 areas:
    1. Religion - not genuine relgion or the devil
    2. Land use - land was a commodity, not a world of spirits
        - Spanish claimed land by right of conquest and papal authority
        - English/French/Dutch claimed land by saying the natives did not actually "use" the land
    3. Gender relations - weak men and mistreated women

## Indian Freedom and European Freedom

### Indian Freedom

- Europeans thought the Indians did not have "freedom"
    - Did not live under government or fixed laws
    - Did not use European definitions of authority
    - Lacked order and discipline present in Europe
    - Did not attatch freedom to individual autonomy or property ownership
- Indian freedom:
    - Free thinking, did not have to agree with the collective thought
    - Kinship ties, group autonomy, mutal obligations to group > individual autonomy
    - Freedom to follow spirtual values
    - Well-being and security of the community

### Christian Liberty

- Freedom from sin: abandon a life of sin ("Christian Liberty")
- Not related to religous toleration
- Religion inseparable from "secular" matters
    - Religion closely tied to economic, politcal, and social status
- Religous unity was important to pubic order

### Freedom and Authority

- Liberty = devotion to higher authority
    - Freedom = obedience to law
- Early European societies were hierarchical
    - Men > women and children
        - "Coverture": when a women married, she lost legal identity to husband
        - King over subjects = husband over family
            - Both "ordained" by God

### Liberty and Liberties

- Liberty came from fullfilling the duties appropriate to one's rank
- Most men lacked the freedom of economic independence
    - Largely controlled and dominated by upper classes
- Remenats of Middle Age "liberties"
    - Formal specific privilages: self-government, no taxes, right to practice a specific trade
    - Granted by contract, royal decree, or purchase
    - No criticism of authority

## Homework question - 8/22

How can scienctific analysis help us understand history?
Please draw examples from the article and any other examples which come to mind.

Scienctific analysis can help us understand history by uncovering new previously unknown information.
For example, in one part of the article talks about the split between the Andes' lowland and highland people about 8,750 years ago.
Without scienctific analysis we would not have the ability to track the split and the differences of DNA between the highland and lowland people.
This would make it impossible to estimate the the amount of lives lost due to European contact, which is an import part of history.
Scienctific analysis also can help us look much further into the past.
For example it can provide insight on things like the end of the dinosaurs or the formation of universe.
