## Longer question

What about the text would you describe as "epic" (using your own definition of "epic")?
Find at least three passages to bring to the discussion that you think exemplify the epic nature of the text.

This text is epic in many ways.
There has already been many encounters with supernatural beings (gods, giants, the main character is 2/3 god, etc).
There has also been cases of supernatural feats (such as the battle agains Humbaba).
In addition there are a set of morals the characters have.
For example, the dream at the start of the second chapter says that Gilgamesh must act justly and not abuse his power.
What is intresting is Gilgamesh's refusal of Humbaba's offer.
It would seem to go against the the idea that Gilgamesh would be a peacekeeper, but it also shows he trusts Enkidu's judgement over Humbaba's word.
