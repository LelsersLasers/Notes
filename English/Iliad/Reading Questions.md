## Longer question 1

Think about who is right, and for what reasons he is right, between Achilles and Agamemnon.
Think about the matter from multiple perspectives, as we will have a brief debate during class for which you will represent one of four sides (Achilles, Agamemnon, the other kings besides Agamemnon or Achilles, and the common soldiery).

I think Achilles is mostly in the right.
He is right in the way that Agamemnon is being very annyoning and effectivly sabotaging their campaign,
but I think the way he went about it was wrong.
He was trying to fight fire with fire by threatening Agamemnon.

## Longer question 2

What do the basic rules of the relationship between the gods and mortals seem to be?
What about the rules of the relationships between the gods and each other?

The rules for the relationships between gods and mortals is mostly one way.
Mortals ask for a favor and get a response,
or make a sacrifice to increase their chances of getting a good response.

The rules for the relationships between gods seems similar to relationships between mortals.
There is a power structure and disagreement, and they act of their own free will (can lie, etc),
but they are also mangaged by eachother (like Hephaestus calming everyone down).

## Longer question - 1

What is the relationship between the commanders and the common soldiers like, especially as it relates to Agamemnon's order to leave in book 2 and Thersites' treatment by Odysseus?
Does this seem like a relationship of mutual respect?
With which group do you most identify?

The relationship is not one of mutal respect.
The soldiers must have some respect for their kings/commanders
otherwise they would not fight, but the commanders don't seem to care too much for their soliders.

As a Bishopian, (I would hope) I am more like the commanders,
however, it is much easier to sympathize with the common soldiers.

## Longer question - 2

What role do the gods play in these two books?
Does it seem positive or negative on the whole to you?

The gods seem like they are just doing things for fun.
Everything they do feels like to them, it is low stakes (like a game).
So what if Zeus grants Thetis' wish and has the Greeks lose?
It's just some human lives.
Overall, I think the gods are just making all the problems the humans have worse
by exagrating them and making smaller actions/problems into big ones.
