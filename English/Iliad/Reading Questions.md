## Longer question 1

Think about who is right, and for what reasons he is right, between Achilles and Agamemnon.
Think about the matter from multiple perspectives, as we will have a brief debate during class for which you will represent one of four sides (Achilles, Agamemnon, the other kings besides Agamemnon or Achilles, and the common soldiery).

I think Achilles is mostly in the right.
He is right in the way that Agamemnon is being very annyoning and effectivly sabotaging their campaign,
but I think the way he went about it was wrong.
He was trying to fight fire with fire by threatening Agamemnon.

## Longer question 2

What do the basic rules of the relationship between the gods and mortals seem to be?
What about the rules of the relationships between the gods and each other?

The rules for the relationships between gods and mortals is mostly one way.
Mortals ask for a favor and get a response,
or make a sacrifice to increase their chances of getting a good response.

The rules for the relationships between gods seems similar to relationships between mortals.
There is a power structure and disagreement, and they act of their own free will (can lie, etc),
but they are also mangaged by eachother (like Hephaestus calming everyone down).

## Longer question - 1

What is the relationship between the commanders and the common soldiers like, especially as it relates to Agamemnon's order to leave in book 2 and Thersites' treatment by Odysseus?
Does this seem like a relationship of mutual respect?
With which group do you most identify?

The relationship is not one of mutal respect.
The soldiers must have some respect for their kings/commanders
otherwise they would not fight, but the commanders don't seem to care too much for their soliders.

As a Bishopian, (I would hope) I am more like the commanders,
however, it is much easier to sympathize with the common soldiers.

## Longer question - 2

What role do the gods play in these two books?
Does it seem positive or negative on the whole to you?

The gods seem like they are just doing things for fun.
Everything they do feels like to them, it is low stakes (like a game).
So what if Zeus grants Thetis' wish and has the Greeks lose?
It's just some human lives.
Overall, I think the gods are just making all the problems the humans have worse
by exagrating them and making smaller actions/problems into big ones.

## Longer question - pick one of the questions

1. What does the deal that Hera and Zeus make concerning the destruction of cities (book 4, lines 35-84) say about the relationship between the gods and mortal life going on down on earth? What can people reasonably expect from their worship of the gods? Similarly, what are the relationships like between gods and other gods (e.g. Ares and Athena certainly don't seem to get along)?
2. **In books 4-5, violence on a widespread scale breaks out in the Iliad. What are some of the characteristics of Homer's descriptions of violence, and what effects do you as a reader feel from these descriptions?**
3. What are the ethics of the destruction of the truce between the Trojans and the Greeks -- the humans certainly seem to have come to a workable solution before the gods mess it up? What motivates the gods to destroy the truce?

The descriptions of violence are very epic.
They are often long worded, detailed, and dramatic
(much more so than in Gilgamesh).
It makes each action feel very important.
It also makes it seem personal, as we often get details about the people.
It is never "and then some random guy over there died",
everyone has a backstory, people that care about them, and people they can about.

# Iliad 06-08 - reading questions 8/31

## Book Seven: Ajax duels with Hector

Book 7 tells the end of the first day of fighting. Apollo and Athena jointly convince Hector to challenge any one of the Achaeans to a dual. The Achaeans eventually choose big Ajax by lot to face Hector. The dual ends in a draw, and Hector and Ajax exchange gifts with one another and depart on friendly terms. At night the Trojans debate whether or not to give Helen back (Antenor says they should, Paris says no). The next day a temporary truce is called so that each side can gather its dead for burial and the Achaeans built a large wall and trench to help them defend their ships.

## Book Eight: The Tide of Battle Turns

Book 8 begins with Zeus boasting about how much more powerful he is than the rest of the gods. He forbids any god from intervening in the fighting and departs for Mount Ida to watch. Both sides fight with varying success until the Trojans (in accord with a favorable decree from Zeus' golden scales) begin to get the upper hand and drive the Achaeans back. At this point Hera and Athena become alarmed and try to intervene, until Zeus finds out and threatens them. The Trojans have been so successful that they are able to make camp on the plain near the Achaean wall.

## Longer question 1

In Andromache's speech (6.482-520), she makes a rare statement about the effects of the fighting on the non-combatants.
What does she choose to emphasize in her speech, and what effect does the speech have on you, the reader?

She emphasizes the loss she already has suffered and the loss their son could suffer.
It makes it feel like Hector is making the "wrong" choice by risking himself fighting.
It also takes the focus on Hector (who has been a very important player for Troy)
and on to the people around him.
In addition, it makes the Greeks look a little excessive in their attack of Troy
and the amount of suffering that has been the result of it.


## Longer question 2

In Hector's speech to Andromache (lines 6.521-555), what heroic ideals does he express?
Do you find these admirable or not admirable?

Hector expresses many heroic ideals.
The largest ideal present is a dedication to the fight.
This is admirable because he is not willing to abandon his people.
He is also doing it to win glory
(which is a heroic ideal, just not nessissarly an admirable one).
He also wants to defend his wife, and not have her taken as a prize.
I think it is admirable that he does not talk about his wife in terms of beauty
compared to how Agamemnon does.
