# 8/23 - Day 2

- Matter
	- How much stuff
	- Has inertia
		- Change in motion/velocity
		- Harder to accelerate
		- Double mass = double inertia
- Weight = force of gravity
	- 9.8 m/s^2 (acceleration)
- Motion
	- Is relative to a reference point
- Mass has gravity
	- Mass attracts mass
	- Takes a lot of mass to create little gravity
		- Weak
	- Double mass = double gravity
		- Cancels out the double inertia -> same acceleration
- Air resistance
	- Low mass = easier to accelerate = more effected by air resistance
	- The air molecules have mass and inertia
		- As the object moves, it hits the air molecules and they transfer some of their inertia to the object
	- If 0 air resistance, all objects fall at the same rate
		- 9.8 m/s^2
- Velocity
	- Change in position over time
	- Vector: magnitude and direction
	- Speed: magnitude only
	- V = delta x / delta t
- Acceleration
	- Change in velocity over time
	- Vector: magnitude and direction
	- A = delta v / delta t
